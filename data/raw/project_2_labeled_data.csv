10412,Climate-related soil saturation and peatland development may have conditioned surface water brownification at a central European lake for millennia.,,,,,Bohemian Forest; Dystrophication; Humic substances; Mid-Holocene climate transition; Natural acidification; Paludification; Soil; Water; Ecosystem,The Science of the total environment,Sci Total Environ,15,12,2022,"""Water brownification has long altered freshwater ecosystems across the northern hemisphere. The intensive surface water brownification of the last 30 years was however preceded by previous long-lasting more humic browning episodes in many catchments. To disentangle a cascade of browning-induced environmental stressors this longer temporal perspective is essential and can be reconstructed using paleolimnological investigations. Here we present a Holocene duration multi-proxy paleolimnological record from a small forest mountain lake in the Bohemian Forest (Czechia) and show that climate-related soil saturation and peatland development has driven surface water brownification for millennia there. A long core retrieved from the central part of the lake was dated using <sup>14</sup>C and <sup>210</sup>Pb, subsampled and analyzed for diatoms and zoological indicator (chironomids, planktonic cladocerans) remains. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) provided a record of elements sensitive to biogeochemical processes connected to browning and catchment development (P, Ti, Al/Rb, Fe/Ti, Mn/Ti, Si/Ti). Three threshold shifts related to the processes of water browning were detected in both diatom and chironomid successions at ~10.7, ~5.5 and ~4.2 cal. ky BP. Since, postglacial afforestation of the catchment ~10.7 cal. ky BP the lake experienced strong thermal stratification of the waters, but after ~6.8 cal. ky BP soil saturation and expansion of peatlands led to effective shading and probable nutrient limitation within the lake ecosystem. The more intensive in-wash of dissolved organic matter appears to decline after ~4.2 cal. ky BP, when the paludified catchment soils became permanently anoxic. Two temporary negative and positive anomalies of browning progress occur at the same time and may be connected with the """"8.2 ka event"""" and the """"4.2 ka event"""", respectively. The key role of peatlands presence in the catchment was manifested in millennial-scaled browning process and a climatic forcing of long-lasting browning is evidenced by coincidence with the moistening of climate across the northern hemisphere after ~6 cal. ky BP.""",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159982,36356759,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:59:08.499396-04:00,No,,

Biological sciences,Proc Biol Sci,01,09,2020,"Lake Hazen, the High Arctic's largest lake, has received an approximately 10-fold increase in glacial meltwater since its catchment glaciers shifted from net mass gain to net mass loss in 2007 common era (CE), concurrent with recent warming. Increased glacial meltwater can alter the ecological functioning of recipient aquatic ecosystems via changes to nutrient budgets, turbidity and thermal regimes. Here, we examine a rare set of five high-resolution sediment cores collected in Lake Hazen between 1990 and 2017 CE to investigate the influence of increased glacial meltwater versus alterations to lake ice phenology on ecological change. Subfossil diatom assemblages in all cores show two major shifts over the past approximately 200 years including: (i) a proliferation of pioneering, benthic taxa at approximately 1900 CE from previously depauperate populations; and (ii) a rise in planktonic taxa beginning at approximately 1980 CE to present-day dominance. The topmost intervals from each sequentially collected core provide exact dates and demonstrate that diatom regime shifts occurred decades prior to accelerated glacial inputs. These data show that diatom assemblages in Lake Hazen are responding primarily to intrinsic lake factors linked to decreasing duration of lake ice and snow cover rather than to limnological impacts associated with increased glacial runoff.",10.1098/rspb.2020.1185,32576110,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:58:34.672466-04:00,No,,

Multi-elemental, infrared spectra, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>210</sup>Pb, and diatom analyses in a 75-cm sediment core were used to reconstruct the recent disturbance history of the lake. The sequence chronology, based mostly on <sup>137</sup>Cs profiles, allowed to infer high sedimentation rates in Balamtetik (~&#x2009;7&#xa0;mm/year) and a nearly cyclic series of disturbance events that can be related to anthropogenic causes such as deforestation and increased development of agriculture and urban areas at local and regional scale. These disturbance events show high local and regional erosion (high Ca, TIC, and Ti), soil organic matter (IR spectra), eutrophication (high P and diatoms), and anoxic bottom water conditions (low Mn) and can be dated to the early 1950s, the late 1950s, and from the 1980s until the 2000s. The entrance of wastewaters is related with an increase in salinity inferred by the diatom record and the organic matter type. The first two disturbance events are related to changes in land use during the agrarian reform that started during the 1940s; the last event is related with the increase in local population and the introduction of intensive agriculture. This last phase of disturbance corresponds with the reports of fish mortality events around 2003; however, high lake turbidity and anoxic bottom waters seem to have been established since the 1980s. The record from Lake Balamtetik also shows that during the intermediate periods, there was a recovery of the lake and its catchment; however, the future trends might be different, as the increase in the speed of organic matter and nutrients arrival to the lake reduces its resilience.",10.1007/s11356-019-04581-9,30887450,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:58:21.826991-04:00,No,,

The record of plant community plots has been less considered in the statistical analysis of modern vegetation and surface pollen, which limits the quantitative estimation of its precise relationship. In this study, the quantitative relationships of compositions and quantities between modern surface pollen and plant community were analyzed, based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, through the analysis of 33 surface soil samples and corresponding vegetation plots from forest, meadow steppe, typical steppe and desert steppe on the Northeast China Transect. Results showed that, in a single plot, the relationships between vegetation and pollen in compositions and quantities were different across all families and genera, dominant and common families and genera, and less common and rare families and genera, respectively, due to the differences in pollen dispersal and pollen productivity. There were significant differences among different vegetation types. The compositions of meadow steppe differed greatly, while all families and genera, dominant and common families and genera differed greatly in the quantitative relationship in forest. Less common and rare families and genera differed greatly in the compositions in meadow steppe. The vegetation-pollen relationship of different families and genera was basically the same in terms of composition and quantities. According to the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, pollen taxa could be divided into three types: over-representative, under-representative and representative types. This dissimilarity index represented both the species composition and quantity relationship between vegetation and pollen both at quadrat scale and at specie level, which could be used as an indicator to quantitatively describe the modern vegetation-pollen relationship. &#x5efa;&#x7acb;&#x73b0;&#x4ee3;&#x690d;&#x88ab;&#x4e0e;&#x8868;&#x571f;&#x82b1;&#x7c89;&#x7684;&#x7cbe;&#x786e;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;,&#x662f;&#x57fa;&#x4e8e;&#x5b62;&#x7c89;&#x8bb0;&#x5f55;&#x5b9a;&#x91cf;&#x91cd;&#x5efa;&#x53e4;&#x690d;&#x88ab;&#x4e0e;&#x53e4;&#x6c14;&#x5019;&#x7684;&#x57fa;&#x7840;&#x4e0e;&#x5173;&#x952e;&#x3002;&#x622a;&#x6b62;&#x76ee;&#x524d;,&#x690d;&#x7269;&#x7fa4;&#x843d;&#x6837;&#x65b9;&#x8bb0;&#x5f55;&#x8f83;&#x5c11;&#x53c2;&#x4e0e;&#x5230;&#x73b0;&#x4ee3;&#x690d;&#x88ab;&#x4e0e;&#x82b1;&#x7c89;&#x7684;&#x7edf;&#x8ba1;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x4e2d;,&#x9650;&#x5236;&#x4e86;&#x5176;&#x7cbe;&#x786e;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;&#x7684;&#x5b9a;&#x91cf;&#x8868;&#x8fbe;&#x3002;&#x672c;&#x6587;&#x901a;&#x8fc7;&#x4e2d;&#x56fd;&#x4e1c;&#x5317;&#x6837;&#x5e26;&#x7684;&#x68ee;&#x6797;&#x3001;&#x8349;&#x7538;&#x8349;&#x539f;&#x3001;&#x5178;&#x578b;&#x8349;&#x539f;&#x548c;&#x8352;&#x6f20;&#x8349;&#x539f;33&#x4e2a;&#x8868;&#x571f;&#x6837;&#x54c1;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x53ca;&#x690d;&#x88ab;&#x6837;&#x65b9;&#x8c03;&#x67e5;,&#x57fa;&#x4e8e;Bray-Curtis&#x76f8;&#x5f02;&#x7cfb;&#x6570;,&#x7814;&#x7a76;&#x4e86;&#x4e1c;&#x5317;&#x6837;&#x5e26;&#x73b0;&#x4ee3;&#x8868;&#x571f;&#x82b1;&#x7c89;&#x4e0e;&#x690d;&#x7269;&#x7fa4;&#x843d;&#x7ec4;&#x6210;&#x548c;&#x6570;&#x91cf;&#x4e4b;&#x95f4;&#x7684;&#x5b9a;&#x91cf;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;&#x3002;&#x7ed3;&#x679c;&#x8868;&#x660e;: &#x7531;&#x4e8e;&#x82b1;&#x7c89;&#x4f20;&#x64ad;&#x8ddd;&#x79bb;&#x548c;&#x82b1;&#x7c89;&#x4ea7;&#x91cf;&#x5927;&#x5c0f;&#x7684;&#x4e0d;&#x540c;,&#x5355;&#x4e2a;&#x6837;&#x70b9;&#x7684;&#x6240;&#x6709;&#x79d1;&#x5c5e;&#x3001;&#x4f18;&#x52bf;&#x548c;&#x5e38;&#x89c1;&#x79d1;&#x5c5e;&#x3001;&#x5c11;&#x89c1;&#x548c;&#x7a00;&#x6709;&#x79d1;&#x5c5e;,&#x5728;&#x7ec4;&#x6210;&#x548c;&#x6570;&#x91cf;&#x4e0a;&#x7684;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;&#x5b58;&#x5728;&#x5dee;&#x5f02;&#x3002;&#x4e0d;&#x540c;&#x690d;&#x88ab;&#x7c7b;&#x578b;&#x95f4;&#x5dee;&#x5f02;&#x663e;&#x8457;,&#x8349;&#x7538;&#x8349;&#x539f;&#x5728;&#x7ec4;&#x6210;&#x4e0a;&#x5dee;&#x5f02;&#x8f83;&#x5927;,&#x800c;&#x6240;&#x6709;&#x79d1;&#x5c5e;&#x3001;&#x4f18;&#x52bf;&#x548c;&#x5e38;&#x89c1;&#x79d1;&#x5c5e;&#x7684;&#x6570;&#x91cf;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;&#x5728;&#x68ee;&#x6797;&#x4e2d;&#x5dee;&#x5f02;&#x8f83;&#x5927;,&#x5c11;&#x89c1;&#x548c;&#x7a00;&#x6709;&#x79d1;&#x5c5e;&#x7684;&#x6570;&#x91cf;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;&#x5219;&#x5728;&#x8349;&#x7538;&#x8349;&#x539f;&#x4e2d;&#x5dee;&#x5f02;&#x8f83;&#x5927;&#x3002;&#x4e0d;&#x540c;&#x79d1;&#x5c5e;&#x7684;&#x690d;&#x88ab;-&#x82b1;&#x7c89;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;&#x5728;&#x7ec4;&#x6210;&#x548c;&#x6570;&#x91cf;&#x4e0a;&#x7684;&#x8d8b;&#x52bf;&#x57fa;&#x672c;&#x4e00;&#x81f4;,&#x6839;&#x636e;Bray-Curtis&#x76f8;&#x5f02;&#x7cfb;&#x6570;&#x53ef;&#x5c06;&#x8be5;&#x5730;&#x533a;&#x82b1;&#x7c89;&#x7c7b;&#x7fa4;&#x5212;&#x5206;&#x4e3a;3&#x7c7b;: &#x8d85;&#x4ee3;&#x8868;&#x6027;&#x7c7b;&#x578b;&#x3001;&#x4f4e;&#x4ee3;&#x8868;&#x6027;&#x7c7b;&#x578b;&#x548c;&#x9002;&#x4e2d;&#x4ee3;&#x8868;&#x6027;&#x7c7b;&#x578b;&#x3002;&#x8be5;&#x7cfb;&#x6570;&#x53ef;&#x4ee5;&#x83b7;&#x5f97;&#x6837;&#x65b9;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x548c;&#x7269;&#x79cd;&#x6c34;&#x5e73;&#x4e0a;&#x690d;&#x88ab;-&#x82b1;&#x7c89;&#x7684;&#x7269;&#x79cd;&#x7ec4;&#x6210;&#x548c;&#x6570;&#x91cf;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;,&#x662f;&#x5b9a;&#x91cf;&#x63cf;&#x8ff0;&#x690d;&#x88ab;-&#x82b1;&#x7c89;&#x5173;&#x7cfb;&#x7684;&#x6709;&#x6548;&#x6307;&#x6807;&#x4e4b;&#x4e00;&#x3002;.",10.13287/j.1001-9332.202102.005,33650353,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:57:26.913519-04:00,No,,

Unfortunately, many inland waters lack sufficient long-term monitoring to assess environmental trends. Analysis of sedimentary ancient DNA ( sedaDNA) is emerging as a means to reconstruct the past occurrence of microbial communities of inland waters. The purpose of this study was to assess a combination of high-throughput sequencing (16S rRNA) of sedaDNA and traditional paleolimnological analyses to explore multidecadal relationships among cyanobacterial community composition, the potential for cyanotoxin production, and paleoenvironmental proxies. DNA was extracted from two sediment cores collected from a northern Canadian Great Plains reservoir. Diversity indices illustrated significant community-level changes since reservoir formation. Furthermore, higher relative abundances in more recent years were observed for potentially toxic cyanobacterial genera including Dolichospermum. Correlation-based network analysis revealed this trend significantly and positively correlated to abundances of the microcystin synthetase gene ( mcyA) and other paleoproxies (nutrients, pigments, stanols, sterols, and certain diatom species), demonstrating synchrony between molecular and more standard proxies. These findings demonstrate a novel approach to infer long-term dynamics of cyanobacterial diversity in inland waters and highlight the power of high-throughput sequencing to reconstruct trends in environmental quality and inform lake and reservoir management and monitoring program design.",10.1021/acs.est.7b06386,29782156,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:56:33.509165-04:00,No,,

Ecosystem monitoring commenced only after the changes became apparent, precluding any examination of timing and dynamics of initial community change in the past and comparison of pre- and postimpact communities. Peri-Alpine Lake Constance (Germany) underwent a mid-century period of eutrophication followed by re-oligotrophication since the 1980s and is now experiencing warm temperatures. We extended the period for which monitoring data of indicator organisms exist by analysing historical environmental DNA (eDNA) from a sediment core dating back some 110&#xa0;years. Using three metabarcoding markers-for microbial eukaryotes, diatoms and cyanobacteria-we revealed two major breakpoints of community change, in the 1930s and the mid-1990s. In our core, the latest response was exhibited by diatoms, which are classically used as palaeo-bioindicators for the trophic state of lakes. Following re-oligotrophication, overall diversity values reverted to similar ones of the early 20th century, but multivariate analysis indicated that the present community is substantially dissimilar. Community changes of all three groups were strongly correlated to phosphorus concentration changes, whereas significant relationships to temperature were only observed when we did not account for temporal autocorrelation. Our results indicate that each microbial group analysed exhibited a unique response, highlighting the particular strength of multimarker analysis of eDNA, which is not limited to organisms with visible remains and can therefore discover yet unknown responses and abiotic-biotic relationships.",10.1111/mec.15696,33070403,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:56:27.206109-04:00,No,,

Holcroft Moss is a rare example of a stratigraphically intact lowland peat bog in NW England, which provides a valuable opportunity to trace industrial impacts on vegetation in a sensitive environmental archive close to the early industrializing cities of Manchester and Liverpool. (2) We reconstructed environmental changes at Holcroft Moss before and after the Industrial Revolution using a decadal-scale record of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, microcharcoal, peat composition (organic content and ash-free bulk density) and heavy metal content, constrained by a radiocarbon and SCP (spheroidal carbonaceous particle) chronology. We examine the relationship between abiotic and biotic environmental tracers using principal component analysis and evaluate the role of local and regional climatic and anthropogenic drivers using canonical redundancy analysis and partitioning of variation.

Prior to 1750&#x2009;CE, climate and agro-pastoral activity (grazing and fires) were the main drivers of vegetation change. Subsequently, regional coal-fired industry contributed to major increases in atmospheric pollutants (dust, heavy metals, and acid deposition) that severely impacted vegetation, driving the decline of <i>Sphagnum</i>. Grasses rose to dominance in the 20th century associated especially with bog conversion and cumulative nitrogen deposition. Although atmospheric pollution significantly decreased in the post-industrial era, vegetation has not returned to pre-industrial conditions, reflecting the ongoing impact of global change drivers which pose challenges for conservation and restoration.

In this study, we focused on eutrophication, which resulted in the transition from rich fen to poor fen conditions on the Kazanie fen (central Greater Poland, western Poland Central Europe). The prior aim was to decipher how i) climate, ii) human, and iii) autogenic processes influenced the pathway of peatland changes in the last ca. 250 years. We applied a high-resolution palaeoecological analysis, based mainly on testate amoebae (TA) and plant macroremains. Our results imply that before ca. 1950 CE, dry shifts on the fen were generally climate-induced. Later, autogenic processes, human pressure and climate warming synergistically affected the fen, contributing to its transition to poor fen within ca. 30 years. Its establishment not only caused changes in vegetation but also altered TA taxonomic content and resulted in a lower diversity of TA. According to our research Microchlamyspatella is an incredibly sensitive testate amoeba that after ca. 200 years of presence, disappeared within 2 years due to changes in water and nutrient conditions.

Combining information from marine diatom records and sea salt sodium and water isotope ice core records, we here document contrasting patterns in sea ice variations between coastal and open sea areas in Western Ross Sea over the current interglacial period. Since about 3600 years before present, an increase in the efficiency of regional latent-heat polynyas resulted in more coastal sea ice, while sea ice extent decreased overall.

Multi-proxy analyses of <sup>210</sup>Pb-dated sediment cores from two hard-water lakes with different land-use histories were applied for assessing carbon cycling and limnological changes in response to land-use changes over the past century in southwest China. Logging of primary forests in the catchment of Lugu Lake, starting in the 1950s, led to a significant increase of catchment erosion, as well as a consistent decline in inferred lake-water total organic carbon (TOC) levels and sediment carbonate accumulation. This process of recent deforestation may significantly reduce the role of lake systems to act as carbon sinks through hampering of both the soil organic carbon flux and the dissolution of catchment carbonate. The decline in lake-water TOC in Lugu Lake further increased algal production (i.e. tracked through sediment trends in chlorophyll a and its main diagenetic products) and changes in diatom composition. In comparison, there was little variation of sediment carbonate content in Chenghai Lake, which has a long history of catchment deforestation, while both primary production and lake-water TOC increased following cultural eutrophication during the last three decades. Furthermore, regional warming was associated with an increase in small-sized diatoms in both deep lakes, likely due to enhanced thermal stability. This study highlights the significant role of vegetation cover and land use in driving aquatic carbon cycling and phototrophs, revealing that deforestation can strongly reduce both inorganic and organic carbon export to lakes and thus aquatic carbon storage in karst landscapes.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141738,32882557,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 14:53:14.480973-04:00,No,,

However, one obstacle in this area of study is the limiting bias in the bioinformatic classification of short fragments of degraded DNA from the large, complex genomes of plants. To establish one possible baseline protocol for the rapid classification of short-read shotgun metagenomic data for reconstructing plant communities, the read classification programs Kraken, Centrifuge, and MegaBLAST were tested on simulated and ancient data with classification against a reference database targeting plants. Performance tests on simulated data suggest that Kraken and Centrifuge outperform MegaBLAST. Kraken tends to be the most conservative approach with high precision, whereas Centrifuge has higher sensitivity. Reanalysis of 13,000 years of ancient sedimentary DNA from North America characterizes potential post-glacial vegetation succession. Classification method choice has an impact on performance and any downstream interpretation of results. The reanalysis of ancient DNA from glacial lake sediments yielded vegetation histories that varied depending on method, potentially changing paleoecological conclusions drawn from molecular evidence.",10.1002/aps3.1034,29732264,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:53:50.728694-04:00,No,,

Here, we provide insights into the biogeographical history of Antarctic freshwater diatoms, using lacustrine fossils from mid-Miocene and Quaternary Antarctica, and dovetail this dataset with a global inventory of modern freshwater diatom communities. We reveal the existence of a diverse mid-Miocene diatom flora bearing similarities with several former Gondwanan landmasses. Miocene cooling and Plio-Pleistocene glaciations triggered multiple extinction waves, resulting in the selective depauperation of this flora. Although extinction dominated, in situ speciation and new colonizations ultimately shaped the species-poor, yet highly adapted and largely endemic, modern Antarctic diatom flora. Our results provide a more holistic view on the scale of biodiversity turnover in Neogene and Pleistocene Antarctica than the fragmentary perspective offered by macrofossils and underscore the sensitivity of lacustrine microbiota to large-scale climate perturbations.",10.1126/sciadv.abh3233,34524843,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:53:03.775904-04:00,No,,

This is especially so over millennial timescales inaccessible to direct observation. Here we examine how energy flow within a Great Basin small mammal community responded to climate-driven environmental change during the past 12,800 y, and use this baseline to evaluate responses observed during the past century. Our analyses reveal marked stability in energy flow during rapid climatic warming at the terminal Pleistocene despite dramatic turnover in the distribution of mammalian body sizes and habitat-associated functional groups. Functional group turnover was strongly correlated with climate-driven changes in regional vegetation, with climate and vegetation change preceding energetic shifts in the small mammal community. In contrast, the past century has witnessed a substantial reduction in energy flow caused by an increase in energetic dominance of small-bodied species with an affinity for closed grass habitats. This suggests that modern changes in land cover caused by anthropogenic activities--particularly the spread of nonnative annual grasslands--has led to a breakdown in the compensatory dynamics of energy flow. Human activities are thus modifying the small mammal community in ways that differ from climate-driven expectations, resulting in an energetically novel ecosystem.

A paucity of environmental monitoring prior to development raises questions about baseline conditions in freshwater systems in the region and ecological responses to industrial activities. Further, climatic changes prompt questions about the relative roles of climate and industry in shaping aquatic ecosystems through time. We use aquatic bioindicators from multiple trophic levels, concentrations of petrogenic contaminants (dibenzothiophenes), and spectrally-inferred chlorophyll-a preserved in well-dated sediments of a closed-basin, shallow lake ~50km away from the main area of industry, in conjunction with climate observations, to assess how the biotic assemblages of a typical AOSR lake have changed during the past ~75years. We examine the contributions of the area's stressors in structuring aquatic communities. Increases in sedimentary measures of petrogenic contaminants provide clear evidence of aerial contaminant deposition from local industry since its establishment, while climate records demonstrate consistent warming and a recent period of reduced precipitation. Quantitative comparisons of biological assemblages from before and after the establishment of regional industry find significant (p&lt;0.05) differences; however, the magnitude and overall timing of the changes are not consistent with a threshold-type shift in response to the onset of regional industry. Rather, biotic assemblages from multiple trophic levels suggest transitions to an increasingly complex benthic environment and relatively warmer waters, which, like the increasing trends in inferred primary production, are consistent with a changing climate.

To assess if climate-mediated ice cover changes affect the diatom response to climate, we used paleolimnological techniques to examine shifts in diatom assemblages from ten High Arctic lakes and ponds from Ellesmere Island and nearby Pim Island (Nunavut, Canada). The sites were divided a priori into four groups (""""warm"""", """"cool"""", """"cold"""", and """"oasis"""") based on local elevation and microclimatic differences that result in differing lengths of the ice-free season, as well as about three decades of personal observations. We characterized the species changes as a shift from Condition 1 (i.e. a generally low diversity, predominantly epipelic and epilithic diatom assemblage) to Condition 2 (i.e. a typically more diverse and ecologically complex assemblage with an increasing proportion of epiphytic species). This shift from Condition 1 to Condition 2 was a consistent pattern recorded across the sites that experienced a change in ice cover with warming. The """"warm"""" sites are amongst the first to lose their ice covers in summer and recorded the earliest and highest magnitude changes. The """"cool"""" sites also exhibited a shift from Condition 1 to Condition 2, but, as predicted, the timing of the response lagged the """"warm"""" sites. Meanwhile some of the """"cold"""" sites, which until recently still retained an ice raft in summer, only exhibited this shift in the upper-most sediments. The warmer """"oasis"""" ponds likely supported aquatic vegetation throughout their records. Consequently, the diatoms of the """"oasis"""" sites were characterized as high-diversity, Condition 2 assemblages throughout the record. Our results support the hypothesis that the length of the ice-free season is the principal driver of diatom assemblage responses to climate in the High Arctic, largely driven by the establishment of new aquatic habitats, resulting in increased diversity and the emergence of novel growth forms and epiphytic species.""",10.1371/journal.pone.0172989,28296897,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:50:09.782319-04:00,No,,

Increases in nutrient and organic C influxes that began in the 1950s, together with elevated primary productivity and increased chemical fertilizer application, suggested a shift toward anthropogenic-predominated environmental changes during this period. The depletion of total organic C (TOC), total N (TN), and biogenic Si (BSi), along with the decline in sedimentation rate and coarsening of sediment coincided with the development of hydrological engineering in the river basin from the 1980s. Reservoir Si retention substantially altered river mouth primary productivity community composition from diatoms to non-diatoms, thereby changing the BSi/TOC molar ratio in the sediment profile. Estimation of biogenic component burial fluxes was conducted to assess the variation and potential impacts. A recent dramatic decline in biogenic component burial in the delta area suggested a low nutrient removal efficiency in this region, due to the decrease in sediment discharge.

The well-preserved late Early Pleistocene sedimentary sequence at Cueva Negra del Estrecho del R&#xed;o Qu&#xed;par (CNERQ) has provided substantial evidence concerning the behavioural and adaptive skills of early humans in Western Europe, such as butchery practices, lithic technology or tending fire, whilst also bearing witness to the bone-altering activities of carnivores. Recent fieldwork has allowed the re-examination of the spatial and taphonomical nature of the macrofaunal assemblage from the upper layers of Complex 2. These layers are somewhat different from most of the underlying sequence, in showing quite a high representation of cranial and post-cranial bones of large mammals, including several Megaloceros carthaginiensis antlers. The presence of Crocuta sp. at Cueva Negra represents one of the earliest instances of this genus in Western Eurasia. Identification of several juvenile Crocuta sp. remains alongside coprolites and bones with carnivore damage, indicates sporadical hyaenid denning activity. Furthermore, the presence of bones with percussion and cut-marks near to several hammerstones suggests a clear albeit limited anthropogenic input. We interpret the available taphonomical and spatial evidence from these layers as reflecting a multi-patterned palimpsest, likely representing the non-simultaneous and short-lived co-existence of hyaenas, humans, and other small carnivores in the Cueva Negra palaeolandscape during the final phase of sedimentation preserved at the site.",10.1038/s41598-021-03547-7,34912011,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 18:13:19.941743-04:00,No,,

Initial potassium-argon radiometric dating indicated that Bukwa was 22&#xa0;Ma, making it the oldest of the East African early Miocene fossil localities known at the time. In contrast, the fauna collected from Bukwa was similar to other fossil localities in the region that were several million years younger. This discrepancy was never resolved, and due to the paucity of primate remains at the site, little subsequent research took place.

Bukwa shares taxa with both stratigraphically older localities (Tinderet, Napak) and with stratigraphically younger localities (Kisingiri, Turkana Basin) perfectly corresponding to our revised radiometric age.

Due to a global population collapse in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the frequency of these clades among the short-tailed albatross population that historically foraged off British Columbia, Canada, is unclear.

Aminostratigraphical data show the sediments were deposited during the Ipswichian (Last Interglacial) Stage. Palynological data indicates deposition during the <i>Carpinus</i> pollen zone of the Ipswichian Stage-the latter part of pollen zone Ip IIb and Ip III. The records are noteworthy not only because they are the first in the British Pleistocene but also because of the geographical occurrences of these two species. <i>Urtica kioviensis</i> is absent from the British flora today and has a modern range in central and eastern Europe (only extending as far west as north-east Germany and Denmark), while the extinct <i>Potamogeton sukaczevii</i> has only been recovered from Late Pleistocene sediments in Belarus, Lithuania, Poland and western Russia.

No modern analogues occur in Britain for the assemblages recovered from Saham Toney. Evidence of colder winters or at least warmer summers at the time of deposition does not support the view that sea-level peaked in the <i>Carpinus</i> zone of the Eemian Stage (correlated with the Ipswichian Stage) associated with increased oceanicity. Southern Britain would have been under the influence of the Atlantic Ocean and a degree of oceanicity is supported by the presence of two thermophilous taxa, <i>Hedera</i> and <i>Ilex</i>, in the pollen spectra from Saham Toney. Alternative explanations for the presence of these exotic species are that they were tolerating mild winters and cooler summers at the time of deposition or exploiting suitable micro-environments. The distribution of <i>P. sukaczevii</i> is probably an artefact of the distribution of expertise in the identification of <i>Potamogeton</i> fossil endocarps rather than having any palaeogeographic or palaeoclimatic significance.

However, the temporally discontinuous nature of this evidence precludes ready assumptions of intrinsic adaptive benefit, and has encouraged diverse explanations for the occurrence of these behaviors, in terms of regional demographic, social and ecological conditions. Here, we present a new high-resolution multi-proxy record of environmental change that indicates that faunal exploitation patterns and lithic technologies track climatic variation across the last 22,300 years in the southern Cape. Conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum and deglaciation were humid, and zooarchaeological data indicate high foraging returns. By contrast, the Holocene is characterized by much drier conditions and a degraded resource base. Critically, we demonstrate that systems for technological delivery - or provisioning - were responsive to changing humidity and environmental productivity. However, in contrast to prevailing models, bladelet-rich microlithic technologies were deployed under conditions of high foraging returns and abandoned in response to increased aridity and less productive subsistence environments. This suggests that posited links between microlithic technologies and subsistence risk are not universal, and the behavioral sophistication of human populations is reflected in their adaptive flexibility rather than in the use of specific technological systems.",10.1016/j.jhevol.2017.09.006,29447760,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:51:33.396339-04:00,No,,

We reconstruct environmental change from a 225-cm-long sediment core from site Los Indios from an abandoned and sediment-filled meander of the Yaque River, Cibao Valley, northeastern Dominican Republic. The sediment record starts ca. AD 195 (ca. 1755 cal. yr BP) and the history of the meander infill was monitored by changing grain size distributions, organic matter concentration and pollen from wetland plants. From ca. AD 200 to ca. AD 1525, the pollen record indicates a diverse forest assemblage; however, the presence of pollen from potential crop plants suggest nearby small-scale subsistence crop cultivation. More abundant charcoal after ca. AD 1410 shows Amerindians increasingly used fire. The record of grain size distributions shows that the meander was temporarily part of a low energetic drainage system in which bedload and suspended sediments accumulated. After European colonization of Hispaniola increasing spores of coprophilous fungi evidence that Europeans had introduced during the first decades of colonization cattle in the Cibao Valley which gradually resulted in more open forest. The charcoal record around ca. AD 1650 reflects intensive forest clearing, suggesting that small-scale Pre-Colonial practice of crop cultivation became replaced by large-scale agriculture on the moist and nutrient rich soils along the Yaque River. Further deforestation and signals of erosion suggest that the population of colonists and introduced enslaved labour force must have increased rapidly. After ca. AD 1740 charcoal influx decreased suggesting that last deforestation activities used selective cutting to produce fire wood and timber for construction, rather than burning forest in situ. Two centuries after European colonization, by the 18th century, land-use within the Cibao Valley had become a balance between substantial livestock and crop cultivation (pollen grains have evidenced cereals, maize, and potentially also sugar cane, amaranthaceous crops and tobacco). After ca. AD 1950, swamp vegetation of <i>Typha</i> and Cyperaceae decreased, pointing to an almost fully terrestrialized meander with only few bodies of standing water, reflecting the present-day setting. This multiproxy reconstruction of anthropogenic environmental change shows a clear differentiation between an immediate introduction of livestock and after some 150 years the development of a European style agriculture, providing a context for archaeological investigations.",10.1177/0959683618788732,30473597,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:47:51.157728-04:00,No,,

The modern bird fauna of High Asia comprises a diversity of both ancient and recently diverged endemics, and thus is of general importance for historical biogeography and understanding the origin of modern high mountain ecosystems. However, the past history of the Central Asian highland avian communities remains practically unknown, as no fossil bird assemblages from high elevation areas were previously reported. In particular, it remains completely unexplored how birds responded to late Quaternary climatic fluctuations. Here we report the first fossil bird fauna from the High Asia and the first fossil birds from Tajikistan. An assemblage from the late Pleistocene through middle Holocene of Istykskaya cave (4060 m) in Eastern Pamir surprisingly comprises a remarkable diversity of waterbirds, including a few species that are completely absent from High Asia today and that were not reported globally from such high altitudes. The diversity of waterbirds incudes taxa of various ecological preferences (shorebirds, underwater and surface feeders, both zoophagous and phytophagous), strongly indicating the presence of a productive waterbody at the vicinity of the site in the past. These observations correspond to recent palaeoclimatic data, implying increased water availability in this region, currently occupied by high mountain semi-deserts. Our findings for the first time show that milder environmental conditions of late Quaternary attracted lowland species to the Central Asian highland wetlands. The reported assemblage yet contains several characteristic highland taxa, indicating a long-time persistence of some Central Asian montane faunistic elements. In particular, it includes the Tibetan Sandgrouse (Syrrhaptes tibetanus), a highly-specialized montane dweller, which is for the first time found in the fossil record.",10.1371/journal.pone.0259151,34705889,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:42:42.449713-04:00,No,,

Because observational records are sparse and temporally limited, past episodes of Arctic warming can help elucidate the magnitude of vegetation response to temperature change. The Last Interglacial ([LIG], 129,000 to 116,000 y ago) was the most recent episode of Arctic warming on par with predicted 21st century temperature change [Otto-Bliesner et al., <i>Philos. Trans.

Here, we present a LIG vegetation record based on ancient DNA in lake sediment and compare it with fossil pollen. Comprehensive plant community reconstructions through the last and current interglacial (the Holocene) on Baffin Island, Arctic Canada, reveal coherent climate-driven community shifts across both interglacials.

However, the shortage of studies regarding tropical-subtropical plants and topsoil phytoliths interferes with the research progress on primitive humanity's utilization of plant resources and paleoclimate in the region. This research focuses on the subtropical mountainous region with a monsoon climate of low latitudes in Southwest China to conduct phytolith morphology analysis of living plants and phytolith/pollen assemblages of topsoil to reveal the indicative significance of vegetation and climate. A total of 111 species from 50 families, including 73 species from 33 tree/shrub families, 31 species from 12 herb families and 7 species from 5 fern families, were collected for morphological characteristics analysis, as well as 19 topsoil specimens for phytolith and pollen assemblage analysis. The results suggest that phytoliths are mainly deposited <i>in situ</i>, with assemblages of topsoil corresponding well with plant types in the quadrat and being able to exhibit constructive species in small regions. In comparison, pollen assemblages of topsoil dominantly respond to regional vegetation due to their long-distance transportation and widespread presence, in addition to their characteristics that correspond to the vegetation in the quadrat. The topsoil phytolith assemblages are mainly based on the elongate-bulliform flabellate-square/rectangle-broadleaf-types (including spheroid echinate), and the vegetation types indicate the subtropical climate. In addition, phytolith assemblages of Poaceae are dominated by collapsed saddle-bulliform flabellate square/rectangle-elongate-point, reflecting warm and humid conditions. The pollen assemblages mainly consist of <i>Pinus</i>, <i>Betula</i>, <i>Alnus</i>, deciduous <i>Quercus</i>, Euphorbiaceae, Rhamnaceae and <i>Polygonum</i>, reflecting tropical-subtropical plant communities and indicating warm and humid conditions.

The site therefore offers the unrivalled opportunity to explore the relationship between these two archaeological phases. In this study, we undertake radiocarbon, stable isotope (carbon, nitrogen and sulphur), and ZooMS analysis of the archaeological faunal assemblage to explore the chronological and environmental context of the Magdalenian and Epimagdalenian deposits. Our results show that the Magdalenian and Epimagdalenian deposits can be understood as discrete units from one another, dating to the Late Glacial between c. 15,630 cal. BP and 14,610 cal. BP, and c. 14,140 cal. BP and 12,680 cal. BP, respectively. Stable isotope results (&#x3b4;<sup>13</sup>C, &#x3b4;<sup>15</sup>N, &#x3b4;<sup>34</sup>S) indicate that Magdalenian and Epimagdalenian activity at K&#x16f;lna Cave occurred in very different environmental settings. Magdalenian occupation took place within a nutrient-poor landscape that was experiencing rapid changes to environmental moisture, potentially linked to permafrost thaw. In contrast, Epimagdalenian occupation occurred in a relatively stable, temperate environment composed of a mosaic of woodland and grassland habitats. The potential chronological gap between the two phases, and their associations with very different environmental conditions, calls into question whether the Epimagdalenian should be seen as a local, gradual development of the Magdalenian. It also raises the question of whether the gap in occupation at K&#x16f;lna Cave could represent a change in settlement dynamics and/or behavioural adaptations to changing environmental conditions.

The tropical ecosystems of Papua New Guinea are areas of diverse rainforest flora and fauna, inhabited by human populations that are equally diverse, both culturally and linguistically. These people and the ecosystems they rely on are being put under increasing pressure from mineral resource extraction, population growth, land clearing, invasive species, and novel pollutants. This study details the last &#x223c;90 y of impacts on ecosystem dynamics in one of the most biologically diverse, yet poorly understood, tropical wetland ecosystems of the region. The lake is listed as a Ramsar wetland of international importance, yet, since initial European contact in the 1930s and the opening of mineral resource extraction facilities in the 1990s, there has been a dramatic increase in deforestation and an influx of people to the area. Using multiproxy paleoenvironmental records from lake sediments, we show how these anthropogenic impacts have transformed Lake Kutubu. The recent collapse of algal communities represents an ecological tipping point that is likely to have ongoing repercussions for this important wetland's ecosystems.

While conservation reserves have been established and population numbers of the giant panda have recently increased, the interpretation of its genetic diversity remains controversial. Previous analyses, surprisingly, have indicated relatively high levels of genetic diversity raising issues concerning the efficiency and usefulness of reintroducing individuals from captive populations. However, due to a lack of DNA data from fossil specimens, it is unknown whether genetic diversity was even higher prior to the most recent population decline. We amplified complete cyt<i>b</i> and 12s rRNA, partial 16s rRNA and <i>ND1</i>, and control region sequences from the mitochondrial genomes of two Holocene panda specimens. We estimated genetic diversity and population demography by analyzing the ancient mitochondrial DNA sequences alongside those from modern giant pandas, as well as from other members of the bear family (Ursidae). Phylogenetic analyses show that one of the ancient haplotypes is sister to all sampled modern pandas and the second ancient individual is nested among the modern haplotypes, suggesting that genetic diversity may indeed have been higher earlier during the Holocene. Bayesian skyline plot analysis supports this view and indicates a slight decline in female effective population size starting around 6000 years B.P., followed by a recovery around 2000 years ago. Therefore, while the genetic diversity of the giant panda has been affected by recent habitat contraction, it still harbors substantial genetic diversity. Moreover, while its still low population numbers require continued conservation efforts, there seem to be no immediate threats from the perspective of genetic evolutionary potential.",10.3390/genes9040198,29642393,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:16:07.254536-04:00,No,,

We combine ethnography, archaeology, paleoecology, and ecological modeling to infer intensive wood and fire use by Native American ancestors of Jemez Pueblo and the consequences on fire size, fire-climate relationships, and fire intensity. Initial settlement of northern New Mexico by Jemez farmers increased fire activity within an already dynamic landscape that experienced frequent fires. Wood harvesting for domestic fuel and architectural uses and abundant, small, patchy fires created a landscape that burned often but only rarely burned extensively. Depopulation of the forested landscape due to Spanish colonial impacts resulted in a rebound of fuels accompanied by the return of widely spreading, frequent surface fires. The sequence of more than 500 y of perennial small fires and wood collecting followed by frequent """"free-range"""" wildland surface fires made the landscape resistant to extreme fire behavior, even when climate was conducive and surface fires were large. The ancient Jemez WUI offers an alternative model for fire management in modern WUI in the western United States, and possibly other settings where local management of woody fuels through use (domestic wood collecting) coupled with small prescribed fires may make these communities both self-reliant and more resilient to wildfire hazards.""",10.1073/pnas.2018733118,33468651,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:05:41.438722-04:00,No,,

Stable isotope data indicate a dry steppe niche for E. sibiricum and, together with morphology, a highly specialized diet that probably contributed to its extinction.

Although much previous work on human-environment interrelationships have emphasised the negative impacts of human interventions, a growing body of work shows that there have also often been strong beneficial connections between people and ecosystems, especially in savanna environments. However, limited information and understanding of past interactions between humans and ecosystems of periods longer than a century hampers effective management of contemporary environments. Here, we present a late Holocene study of pollen, fern spore, fungal spore, and charcoal analyses from radiocarbon-dated sediment sequences and assess this record against archaeological and historical data to describe socio-ecological changes on the Laikipia Plateau in Rift Valley Province, Kenya. The results suggest a landscape characterised by closed forests between 2268&#xa0;years before present (cal&#xa0;year BP) and 1615&#xa0;cal&#xa0;year BP when there was a significant change to a more open woodland/grassland mosaic that continues to prevail across the study area.

Drawing on zooarchaeological and new geochemical datasets, this study investigates human management of Bahamian hutias as cultural practice at indigenous Lucayan settlements in The Bahamas and the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands. In order to determine how hutia diet and distribution together were influenced by Lucayan groups we conducted isotopic analysis on native hutia bone and tooth enamel recovered at the Major's Landing site on Crooked Island in The Bahamas and introduced hutias from the Palmetto Junction site on Providenciales in the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands. Results indicate that some hutias consumed 13C-enriched foods that were either provisioned or available for opportunistic consumption. Strontium isotope ratios for hutia tooth enamel show a narrow range consistent with local origin for all of the archaeological specimens. In contrast, analysis of strontium isotopes in modern Bahamian hutia teeth from animals relocated to Florida from The Bahamas demonstrates that these animals rapidly lost their Bahamian signature and adopted a Florida signature. Therefore, strontium should be used cautiously for determining hutia provenance, particularly for individuals that were translocated between islands. Overall, our findings suggest that ancient human presence did not always result in hutia vulnerability and that the impact to hutia populations was variable across pre-Columbian indigenous settlements.",10.1371/journal.pone.0220284,31550252,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:06:27.129097-04:00,No,,

To better understand how social complexity relates to human-animal interactions at Mycenae, more research is needed on the animals who actually lived there. In a first for the archaeological site of Mycenae, we utilized a contextual taphonomic approach and statistical analysis to study a faunal assemblage, focusing on a massive deposit recovered from a well feature located in Room &#x3a0; of Petsas House. Petsas House was an industrial-residential complex at Mycenae used at least in part by ceramic artisans at the time of its destruction in the Late Helladic IIIA2 period. Intra-contextual analysis of the animal remains detected sub-assemblages with variable histories of animal use and deposition. The results revealed multiple disposal events and possible dog interments. Most of the refuse in the well likely originated from rubbish piles in the surrounding rooms and periphery that were cleaned after a destructive earthquake. Together, the faunal evidence yielded a more nuanced, possibly seasonal picture of animal access than previously available at this important political center.

We test this model with the rich faunal assemblage from the EMP (&gt;140 ka) site of Misliya Cave, Mount Carmel, Israel. Excavations in Misliya yielded a large and diverse lithic assemblage, combustion features, and a modern human maxilla, together with a large archaeofaunal assemblage that we use as a spatial marker. We analyzed the distribution of bone items with variable taphonomic properties (anthropogenic, biogenic, and abiotic bone-surface modifications) in a hearth-related context, both by comparing grid squares and point patterns. Both analyses are largely congruent. They indicate repeated and consistent use of the site's space that includes hearth-related consumption activities and peripheral activities further away, albeit with little evidence for site maintenance. Thus, the Misliya results display a mixed signal of clear around-the-fire pattern and differential space use in the EMP that is reminiscent of the much later MP sites in the Levant, but without the more elaborate camp maintenance.

One site, known as Palmrose (35CLT47), provides compelling evidence for the presence of one of the earliest examples of a rectangular plank house along the Oregon Coast. Previous research suggests habitation of the Palmrose site occurred between 2340 cal BC to cal AD 640. However, recent research highlights significant chronometric hygiene concerns of previously reported radiocarbon dates for the Seaside area, calling into question broader regional chronologies. This paper presents a revised chronology for the Palmrose site based on 12 new accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates of ancient cervid bones. I evaluate these new dates and previously reported radiocarbon dates from the site, applying chronometric hygiene assessments and Bayesian statistics to build a refined chronology for the Palmrose site. Calibration of the 12 AMS radiocarbon dates suggests an initial occupation range from 345-55 cal BC and a terminal occupation range from cal AD 225-340-. Bayesian modeling of the Palmrose sequence suggests initial occupation may have spanned from 195-50 cal BC and the terminal occupation from cal AD 210-255. Modeling suggests the maximum range of occupation may span from 580-55 cal BC to cal AD 210-300 based on the start and end boundary calculations. Bayesian modeling of radiocarbon dates directly associated with the plank house deposits suggests the plank house's occupation may have spanned from 160-1 cal BC to cal AD 170-320.

The region around the site comprised mountains, hills, and plains, which was a compatible environment for the cultivation of various crops. Previous studies have suggested that the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are one of the most productive regions for rice cultivation. Besides rice, however, seven dryland crops have been found at the Wanfunao site: foxtail millet, broomcorn millet, wheat, barley, oat, buckwheat, and adzuki bean. Among them, foxtail millet and rice are most ubiquitous. The crop assemblage has revealed that the northern dryland crops, including those were newly adapted cereals such as foxtail millet, wheat, and barley, gradually dispersed southward and became a part of the diet along with rice. This can be attributed to southern Chinese inhabitants' reclamation of the hilly environment for agriculture. Although communities in southern China had cultivated rice on the plains for thousands of years, newly introduced dryland crops from north China adapted to mountainous environments better. The development of multi-cropping systems in southern China likely involved changes in agricultural ontology associated with the adaptation of northern crops in southern environments newly encountered. Additionally, the assemblage of foxtail millet grain/rice spikelet base in the site may have been used for livestock feeding.

In East-Central (EC) Europe, groups of Palaeolithic humans were present throughout the last glacial maximum, but disappeared suddenly around 15,200&#xa0;cal BP. In this study cave sediment profiles dated using radiocarbon techniques and a large set of mammal bones dated directly by AMS <sup>14</sup>C were used to determine local extinction times. These were, in turn, compared to changes in the total megafauna population of EC Europe derived from coprophilous fungi, the Epigravettian population decline, quantitative climate models, pollen and plant macrofossil inferred climate, as well as to biome reconstructions. The results suggest that the population size of large herbivores decreased in the area after 17,700&#xa0;cal BP, when temperate tree abundance and warm continental steppe cover both increased in the lowlands. Boreal forest expansion started around 16,200&#xa0;cal BP.

The population decline of the large herbivore fauna slightly preceded changes in terrestrial vegetation, and likely facilitated it via a reduction in the intensity of grazing and the concomitant accumulation of plant biomass.

Pollen analysis showed that the humans lived in a landscape that was predominated by forest-steppe. Consolidating with multidisciplinary evidence, we learned that Epipaleolithic sites were occupied by microlithic hunter-gatherers and comprised by relatively fixed seasonal central campsites, and their mobility was significantly decreased from the early to late period.

The record from Lake Tislit shows that the northern Sahara and the Mediterranean region were wetter in the AHP because of increased winter precipitation and were not influenced by the monsoon. The increased seasonal contrast of insolation led to an intensification and southward shift of the Mediterranean winter precipitation system in addition to the intensified summer monsoon. Therefore, a winter rainfall zone must have met and possibly overlapped the monsoonal zone in the Sahara. Using a mechanistic vegetation model in Early Holocene conditions, we show that this seasonal distribution of rainfall is more efficient than the increased monsoon alone in generating a green Sahara vegetation cover, in agreement with observed vegetation.

We assembled a highly-complete local DNA reference library (PhyloAlps, 3923 plant taxa), and used this to obtain an exceptionally rich sedaDNA record of 366 plant taxa. Vegetation mainly responded to climate during the early Holocene, while human activity had an additional influence on vegetation from 6 ka onwards. Land-use shifted from episodic grazing during the Neolithic and Bronze Age to agropastoralism in the Middle Ages. Associated human deforestation allowed the coexistence of plant species typically found at different elevational belts, leading to levels of plant richness that characterise the current high diversity of this region.

However, there are few records of quantitative climate reconstruction dating to the last glacial cycle in areas dominated by the Asian summer monsoon. Here, using a pollen-based quantitative climate reconstruction based on three sites in areas exposed to the Asian summer monsoon, we demonstrate that climate has undergone great variability over the past 68&#xa0;ka. The differences between the last glacial and the Holocene optimum could have been as much as 35%-51% for precipitation, and 5-7&#xa0;&#xb0;C for mean annual temperature. Our findings also reveal regional heterogeneity during the abrupt climate events of Heinrich Event 1 and Younger Dryas, that drove drier conditions in southwestern China dominated by the Indian summer monsoon, and a wetter climate in central eastern China. The pattern of variation in reconstructed precipitation, exhibiting strong glacial-interglacial variability, is broadly consistent with the stalagmite &#x3b4;<sup>18</sup>O records from Southwest China and South Asia. Our results of reconstruction quantify the sensitivity of the MIS3 precipitation to orbital insolation changes, and highlight the prominent influence of interhemispheric temperature gradients on Asian monsoon variability. Comparison with transient simulations and major climate forcings has shown that the mode of precipitation variability during the transition from the last glacial maximum to the Holocene has been significantly modulated by weak or collapsed Atlantic meridional overturning circulation events in addition to insolation forcing.",10.1016/j.scib.2023.03.013,36934013,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:23:46.487267-04:00,No,,

However, recent severe drought-induced diebacks raise concern on the future persistence of these forests and of Southern European mesophilous woodlands overall, growing at their dry edge. To explore the history of Apennine beech-dominated forests, we draw on the multiproxy paleoecological record from Lago Verdarolo, which includes a robust vegetation-independent temperature reconstruction. Numerical techniques are used to investigate the drivers of long-term Mediterranean mountain forest dynamics. Specifically, we focus on disentangling the ecological factors that caused the shift from high-diversity mixed forests to beech-dominated stands and on assessing the occurrence of legacy effects on present-day forests. Abrupt climate change largely drove vegetation dynamics during the Late Glacial and Early Holocene. Species-rich mixed <i>Abies alba</i> (silver fir) forests dominated about 10,500-5500&#xa0;years ago, under rather dry and warmer-than-today conditions (+&#x2009;1-2&#xa0;&#xb0;C) and limited fire occurrence. Cooler and moister summers and increasing fire activity caused declines in several fire-sensitive temperate deciduous trees (for example, <i>Ulmus, Tilia, Fraxinus</i>) and favored the establishment of fir-beech forests around 5500&#xa0;years ago. Further enhancement of fire activity and farming around 2000&#xa0;years ago led to local <i>Abies alba</i> extinction and forest impoverishment. We conclude that the currently widespread monospecific Apennine beech forests are the result of multi-millennial land-use intensification superimposed on Late Holocene cooling and moistening.

However, it remains unclear when it comes to the environmental mechanism for early humans exploiting piedmont zones. Here we present a case study about the interactions between early human activities and landscape evolution in the piedmont of Taihang Mountain, an area with prominent ecological and cultural significance in Chinese history. Based on chronological and pollen analyses, we reconstruct the regional landscape evolution in the Fengtougang (FTG) site of southern Taihang Mountain during the Holocene. The results show that the area has been dominated by terrestrial plants since the late Longshan culture (4000 BP), including a large number of <i>Pinus, Artemisia, Spiraea</i>, and <i>Gramineae</i>, a few <i>Cattails</i>, and some other aquatic herbs. During the early history (4000-2000 BP), there is a combination of <i>Pinus, Artemisia, Spiraea, Compositae</i>, and <i>Selaginella Chinensis</i>, with a few aquatic plants. Since the late history (500 BP), the <i>Chinese selaginella, Pinus, Selaginella</i>, and <i>Sedge families</i> dominate, with no aquatic plant pollen found. Combining the detailed geoarchaeological survey, grain size analysis, and magnetic susceptibility analysis, we demonstrate that there should be a landscape of extensive floodplain during the early-middle Holocene (10000-4000 BP). During the late Longshan culture (about 4000 BP), the study area should be dominated by a landscape of sparse forest grassland with interlacing rivers and lakes. With river downcutting and watercourse fixation since the late Longshan culture, the flooded area massively shrinks, providing suitable habitat for human settlement.

On the basis of chironomid and diatom assemblage changes, and supported by sediment chemical data and historical information, we distinguished two main phases in lake evolution. Before 1926 the lake was dominated by chironomids belonging to Micropsectra insignilobus-type and benthic diatoms suggesting well-oxygenated oligotrophic environment with only small-scale disturbance. We considered this state as the lake's safe operational space. After 1926 significant changes occurred: Tanytarsus lugens-type and T. mendax-type chironomids took over dominance and collector filterers increased until 1970 pointing to an increase in available nutrients. The diatom community showed the most pronounced change between 1950 and 1992 when planktonic diatoms increased. The highest trophic level was reconstructed between 1970 and 1992, while the indicator species of increasing nutrient availability, Asterionella formosa spread from 1982 and decreased rapidly at 1992. Statistical analyses evidenced that the main driver of the diatom community change was atmospheric reactive nitrogen (Nr) fertilization that drastically moved the community towards planktonic diatom dominance from 1950. The transformation of the chironomid community was primarily driven by summer mean temperature increase that also changed the dominant feeding guild from collector gatherers to collector filterers. Our results overall suggest that the speed of ecosystem reorganisation showed an unprecedented increase over the last 100&#x202f;years; biological systems in many cases underwent threshold type changes, while several system components displayed non-hysteretic change between alternating community composition.

Towards the end of this period an increasing water table is recorded and the fen turns into a lake, despite more arid conditions. In the Late Bronze Age, the presence of important palatial centres modified the landscape resulting in decrease of mixed deciduous oak woodland and increase in open land, partly used for grazing.

In response, active restoration projects of extant large-sized species or functional substitutes are needed at large scales to promote ecological processes that are important for ecosystem self-regulation and biodiversity maintenance. Despite the desired global scope of such projects, they have received little attention in East Asia. Here, we synthesise the biogeographical and ecological knowledge of megabiota in ancient and modern China, with relevant data mostly located in eastern monsoonal China (EMC), aiming to assess its potential for restoring functionally intact ecosystems modulated by megabiota. We found that during the Late Pleistocene, 12 mammalian megafaunal (carnivores &#x2265;15&#x2009;kg and herbivores &#x2265;500&#x2009;kg) species disappeared from EMC: one carnivore Crocuta ultima (East Asian spotted hyena) and 11 herbivores including six megaherbivores (&#x2265;1000&#x2009;kg). The relative importance of climate change and humans in driving these losses remains debated, despite accumulating evidence in favour of the latter. Later massive depletion of megafauna and large-sized (45-500&#x2009;kg) herbivores has been closely associated with agricultural expansion and societal development, especially during the late Holocene. While forests rich in large timber trees (33 taxa in written records) were common in the region 2000-3000&#x2009;years ago, millennial-long logging has resulted in considerable range contractions and at least 39 threatened species. The wide distribution of C. ultima, which likely favoured open or semi-open habitats (like extant spotted hyenas), suggests the existence of mosaic open and closed vegetation in the Late Pleistocene across EMC, in line with a few pollen-based vegetation reconstructions and potentially, or at least partially, reflecting herbivory by herbivorous megafauna. The widespread loss of megaherbivores may have strongly compromised seed dispersal for both megafruit (fleshy fruits with widths &#x2265;40&#x2009;mm) and non-megafruit plant species in EMC, especially in terms of extra-long-distance (&gt;10&#x2009;km) dispersal, which is critical for plant species that rely on effective biotic agents to track rapid climate change. The former occurrence of large mammals and trees have translated into rich material and non-material heritages passed down across generations. Several reintroduction projects have been implemented or are under consideration, with the case of Elaphurus davidianus a notable success in recovering wild populations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, although trophic interactions with native carnivorous megafauna have not yet been restored. Lessons of dealing with human-wildlife conflicts are key to public support for maintaining landscapes shared with megafauna and large herbivores in the human-dominated Anthropocene. Meanwhile, potential human-wildlife conflicts, e.g. public health risks, need to be scientifically informed and effectively reduced.

Although rising precipitation is well known during the mid to late Holocene, human actions manipulated climate-driven hydrological changes on the landscape, revealing differing histories of human landscape domestication. Environmental factors are unable to account for local differences without the mediation of human communities that transformed the region to its current savanna/forest/wetland mosaic beginning at least 3,500 y ago. Regional environmental variables did not drive the choices made by farmers and fishers, who shaped these local contexts to better manage resource extraction. The savannas we observe today were created in the post-European period, where their fire regime and structural diversity were shaped by cattle ranching.",10.1073/pnas.2022206118,34580203,Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:20:39.932876-04:00,No,,

The sedimentary sequences revealed dynamic terrestrial and lacustrine environments during 23.0-11.7&#x2009;cal ka BP, the climate was relatively cold and dry, and the vegetation was dominated by evergreen-deciduous broadleaf and coniferous mixed forest. During 11.7-4.4&#x2009;cal ka BP, the Quercus- and Castanopsis-dominated evergreen-deciduous broadleaf mixed forest expanded, while the Poaceae and Artemisia were still the major terrestrial herbs under warmer and more humid conditions. After this period, the climate became relatively cool and dry again, and the vegetation landscape was comparatively stable, as it remains today. Wild rice likely grew before Neolithic humans occupied this area. The variations in Oryza-type Poaceae pollen spectra and distributions of Neolithic archaeological sites indicate rice agriculture may have first appeared and developed with human occupation in ca. 7.0-4.4 ka BP. During the historical period, beginning approximately 4 ka BP, a clear signal of intensified anthropogenic disturbance is evident from the clearing of forests, high charcoal concentrations and the presence of rice pollen in large quantities.

One strategy to minimize this limitation is to select a study site in an area that is marginal for agricultural activity. Here, we present a new sediment record from Lake Svityaz in northwestern Ukraine. We have reconstructed regional and local vegetation and fire dynamics since the Late Glacial using pollen, spores, macrofossils and charcoal. Boreal forest composed of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> and <i>Betula</i> with continental <i>Larix decidua</i> and <i>Pinus cembra</i> established in the region around 13,450&#xa0;cal bp, replacing an open, steppic landscape.

Fire activity was highest during the Early Holocene, when summer solar insolation reached its maximum. <i>Carpinus betulus</i> and <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> established at ca. 6,000&#xa0;cal bp, coinciding with the first indicators of agricultural activity in the region&#xa0;and a transient climatic shift to cooler and moister conditions.

The persistence of highly diverse mixed forest under absent or low anthropogenic disturbance until the Early Middle Ages corroborates the role of human impact in the impoverishment of temperate forests elsewhere in Central Europe.

This study quantitatively reconstructs the past regional plant cover in the Songnen grasslands (northeastern China) and explores the relative importance of climate, fire, and human activity on vegetation dynamics. For this purpose, the Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model is applied to three pollen records from two areas, two in the center of the Songnen grasslands and one located in an area marginal to the grasslands. Results from the most reliable REVEALS scenarios show that from the mid-Holocene, steppe (mean cover 40.6%) and dry steppe (mean cover 54.2%) alternately dominated the central part of the Songnen grasslands while the marginal grasslands were mainly characterized by alternating broadleaved forests (mean cover 26.3%), coniferous forests (mean cover 41.9%) and dry steppes (mean cover 30.1%). By comparing the plant cover results with previous published regional climate, fire and human activity records, the results show that long term vegetation dynamics were mainly driven by East Asia Summer Monsoon (EASM) and the related precipitation variations, but was also affected by fire frequency and human activity. Moreover, vegetation evolution was sensitive to abrupt cooling events including the 4.2 ka BP and stacked ice-rafted debris (IRD) events; the change from steppe to dry steppe, for example, was driven by these abrupt climate changes.

Understanding how aquatic ecosystems will respond to anthropogenic stressors and accelerated warming requires shifting from short-term and static to long-term, dynamic characterizations of human-terrestrial-aquatic relationships. Here we use sediment records from Lake Llaviucu, a tropical mountain Andean lake long accessed by Indigenous and post-European societies, and hypothesize that under natural historical conditions (i.e., low human pressure) vegetation and aquatic ecosystems' responses to change are coupled through indirect climate influences-that is, past climate-driven vegetation changes dictated limnological trajectories. We used a multi-proxy paleoecological approach including drivers of terrestrial vegetation change (pollen), soil erosion (Titanium), human activity (agropastoralism indicators), and aquatic responses (diatoms) to estimate assemblage-wide rates of change and model their synchronous and asynchronous (lagged) relationships using Generalized Additive Models. Assemblage-wide rate of change results showed that between ca. 3000 and 400 calibrated years before present (cal years BP) terrestrial vegetation, agropastoralism and diatoms fluctuated along their mean regimes of rate of change without consistent periods of synchronous rapid change. In contrast, positive lagged relationships (i.e., asynchrony) between climate-driven terrestrial pollen changes and diatom responses (i.e., asynchrony) were in operation until ca. 750 cal years BP. Thereafter, positive lagged relationships between agropastoralism and diatom rates of changes dictated the lake trajectory, reflecting the primary control of human practices over the aquatic ecosystem prior European occupation. We interpret that shifts in Indigenous practices (e.g., valley terracing) curtailed nutrient inputs into the lake decoupling the links between climate-driven vegetation changes and the aquatic community.

Although taphonomy and palynology of cave deposits are complex, pollen assemblage represents a reliable source for inferring past vegetation; indeed, climatic, environmental, and cultural interactions determine fossil pollen record.

They form the basis for typo-chronological classification and the establishment of phases and periods. Central European Bronze Age material culture from burials reveals changes during the Bronze Age and represents a perfect case study for analyzing phenomena of cultural change and the adoption of innovation in the societies of prehistoric Europe. Our study focuses on the large-scale change in material culture which took place in the second millennium BC and the emergence at the same period of new burial rites: the shift from inhumation burials in flat graves to complex mounds and simple cremation burials. Paul Reinecke was the first to divide the European Bronze Age (EBA) into two phases, Bz A1 and A2. The shift from the first to the second phase has so far been ascribed to technical advances. Our study adopted an innovative approach to quantifying this phenomenon. Through regressive reciprocal averaging and Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon-dated grave contexts located in Switzerland and southern Germany, we modelled chronological changes in the material culture and changes in burial rites in these regions in a probabilistic way. We used kernel density models to summarize radiocarbon dates, with the aim of visualizing cultural changes in the third and second millennium BC. In 2015, Stockhammer et al. cast doubt on the chronological sequence of the Reinecke phases of the EBA on the basis of newly collected radiocarbon dates from southern Germany. Our intervention is a direct response to the results of that study. We fully agree with Stockhammer's et al. dating of the start of EBA, but propose a markedly different dating of the EBA/MBA transition. Our modelling of radiocarbon data demonstrates a statistically significant typological sequence of phases Bz A1, Bz A2 and Bz B and disproves their postulated chronological overlap.

We present one of the first applications of PyRate to a micropalaeontological global occurrence dataset, reconstructing diversification rates within a Bayesian framework from the Mesozoic to the Neogene in four microfossil groups: planktic foraminiferans, calcareous nannofossils, radiolarians and diatoms. Calcareous and siliceous groups demonstrate opposed but inconsistent responses in diversification. Radiolarian origination increases from <i>c</i>.&#x2009;104&#x2009;Ma, maintaining high rates into the Cenozoic. Calcareous microfossil diversification rates significantly declines across the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary, while rates in siliceous microfossil groups remain stable until the Paleocene-Eocene transition. Diversification rates in the Cenozoic are largely stable in calcareous groups, whereas the Palaeogene is a turbulent time for diatoms. Diversification fluctuations are driven by climate change and fluctuations in sea surface temperatures, leading to different responses in the groups generating calcareous or siliceous microfossils. Extinctions are apparently induced by changes in anoxia, acidification and stratification; speciation tends to be associated with upwelling, productivity and ocean circulation. These results invite further micropalaeontological quantitative analysis and study of the effects of major transitions in the fossil record. Despite extensive occurrence data, regional diversification events were not recovered; neither were some global events.

Based on the context of recovery, coprolites are assigned to the Late Woodland and Terminal Late Woodland periods (ca. 600-1050 AD). Given the scarcity of human remains from this time period, these dog coprolites can be useful as a proxy for understanding human diet during the Late Woodland period. We find that the Late Woodland dogs consumed a variety of fish as well as bird and plant taxa, possibly including maize, and also harbored intestinal parasites and pathogenic bacteria. By sequencing the fecal microbiome of the coprolites, we find some similarities to modern dog microbiomes, as well as specific taxa that can be used to discriminate between modern and ancient microbiomes, excluding soil contaminants. As dogs are often used as a surrogate to assess human diet, humans living with these dogs likely had a similar diet and were affected by similar parasites.

The Fayum fossils can be grouped into four successive and stratigraphically distinct faunal assemblages. Each of these mammalian assemblages is compared with modern mammal communities. Six communities from modern African forest habitats and six communities from woodland bushland habitats are used to produce typical models of ecological diversity. An ecological spectrum for each modern community is generated by assigning mammal species to categories of taxonomic, diet, and body size diversity. Modern forest communities have a higher diversity of rodents and primates, a high diversity of frugivores, low diversity of grazers, and show a steep gradient in body size distribution from a high diversity of small species towards a low diversity of large species. Woodland-bushland communities have a higher diversity of ungulates and carnivores, a low diversity of frugivores but a high diversity of grazers, and a more even body size distribution. Diversity spectra from the four successive Fayum fossil assemblages are compared with the models derived from the modern mammal communities.

In some areas of northern Mongolia, mountainous tundra zones also support a low-latitude population of domestic reindeer herders-a lifestyle whose origins are poorly characterized in the archaeological record of early Mongolia. Traditionally, reindeer pastoralists make significant seasonal use of munkh mus (eternal ice) for their domestic herds, using these features to cool heat-stressed animals and provide respite from insect harassment. In recent years, many of these features have begun to melt entirely for the first time, producing urgent threats to traditional management techniques, the viability of summer pastures, and reindeer health. The melting ice is also exposing fragile organic archaeological materials that had previously been contained in the patch. We present the results of horseback survey of ice patches in Baruun Taiga special protected area, providing the first archaeological insights from the region. Results reveal new evidence of historic tool production and wild resource use for fishing or other activities, and indicate that ice patches are likely to contain one of the few material records of premodern domestic reindeer use in Mongolia and lower Central Asia.

Our previous studies based on macrofossil remains and phytoliths revealed that rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) from Qujialing was already domesticated, and millet (<i>Setaria italica</i> and <i>Panicum miliaceum</i>) had also been spread into the site since the Youziling Culture period (5800-5100 BP). Nevertheless, no direct evidence has been provided regarding the daily consumed plant foods, especially plant foods obtained by gathering, throughout the site occupation. This paper thus examines pottery sherds (n=41) associated with culinary practices from Qujialing with starch grain analysis. Apart from starch grains from rice and millet, the results indicate that job's tears (<i>Coix lacryma-jobi</i>), lotus roots (<i>Nelumbo nucifera</i>), tubers possibly from Chinese yam (<i>Dioscorea panthainca</i>), acorns (<i>Quercus</i> sp.), and beans (<i>Vigna</i> sp. or/and <i>Vicia</i> sp.) were consumed by the ancient Qujialing people, within job's tears and lotus roots were not discovered before in the macrofossil remains and phytoliths. Combining the starch data and multiple lines of evidence from macrofossil remains and phytoliths, it is suggested that rice was among the most frequently consumed plant foods since the first occupation phase at Qujialing, while acorns could have been gradually replaced by other agricultural products (i.e., rice) and became less important food ingredients, especially when agriculture was more developed in the last occupation phase at Qujialing.

Recent findings have highlighted that in addition to human pressures, alkalinity may also play a role for community composition as bicarbonate becomes an increasingly important carbon source for photosynthesis when alkalinity increases. With this study, we aimed to elucidate how alkalinity influences the distribution of diatoms in Danish lowland streams, and to explore ifdiatom assemblage patterns can be affected by alkalinity in a way that interferes with the ecological assessment using diatom-based indices. We found that alkalinity affect the benthic algae community in lowland streams and that different species of diatoms were associated with different levels of alkalinity, a finding that might indicate dissimilarities in the efficiency of their HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> use. Nitzschia intermedia, Synedra acus, Nitzschia recta, Diatoma tenue, and Nitzschia linearis were associated with high alkalinity, whereas Synedra rumpens, Fragilaria vaucheriae, Psammothidium bioretii, and Gomphonema parvulum were associated with low alkalinity in streams with very low levels of phosphate. We also found that the Danish indicator for ecological status in streams (a combination of two Austrian indices, the Saprobic Index (SID) and the Trophic Index (TID) may exceed levels acceptable for good ecological status in moderate to high alkaline streams despite low phosphate levels.

We found that taxonomic and functional observed and dark diversity increased over time, especially after the Late Glacial and during the Late Holocene. However, dark diversity dynamics revealed expansion lags related to species' functional characteristics (dispersal limitation and stress intolerance) and an extensive functional redundancy when compared to taxa in observed diversity.

Exposed to natural hazards, including El Ni&#xf1;o events, and to major climatic changes, they were able to adapt and exploit the scarce resources that this extreme environment offered them.

This paper present the results of a multidisciplinary study of Huaca Grande, a mound located on Nunura Bay, 300 m from the Pacific Ocean. The nature of the human occupations at Huaca Grande was varied, and several adjustments occurred over time. The subsistence economy was based mainly on local marine resources and a continual use of terrestrial vegetal resources. However, a major change occurred in the more recent occupations, with the apparition of non-local resources (maize and cotton) indicating that Huaca Grande was connected to trade networks. The results show two main phases of occupation separated by a long abandonment (mid-5th century CE to mid-7th century CE and mid-13th century to mid-15th century CE).

However, uniquely in Western Europe, farming strategies in Italy began to evolve centuries before the Roman conquest, and many 'Roman' patterns associated with livestock size and the relative proportions of different taxa first emerged during the early and middle centuries of the first millennium BC. These changes imply a significant reorganisation of production strategies well before Roman hegemony, even in relatively marginal areas of Italy. Zooarchaeological studies have documented further significant changes to livestock production in Roman times, but the relationship between these developments and earlier trends remains unclear. Through analysis of zooarchaeological data for species representation and livestock biometry from lowland northern Italy (Po-Friulian Plain), this study investigates animal exploitation between the Bronze Age and Late Antiquity in order to characterise the influence of Roman political and economic organisation on animal husbandry. Results demonstrated subregional variation in species representation, and different trajectories in the biometric evolution of cattle, sheep and goats, compared to pigs. Initial steps established in the Iron Age towards a more complex and dynamic livestock economy were accelerated and further reconfigured in Roman times, facilitated by Roman economic organisation and the specialised and large-scale production systems within it. Zooarchaeological trends continued to progress over the Roman period, until further changes at the very end of the chronology considered here-around the sixth century AD-suggest another wave of change.

Its rapid narrowing at the Tortonian - Messinian transition around 7.2 Ma, resulting from very intense tectonic activity, has triggered an ecological crisis well before the deposition of the Messinian Salinity crisis evaporites. The sedimentary successions deposited in the Sa&#xef;s Basin have recorded different events regarding biostratigraphic, environmental, tectonic, and eustatic that characterized the area during the late Miocene. In order to get information on the marine and continental environment during the Tortonian-Messinian Transition (TMT), a palynological and biostratigraphic study was carried out on two boreholes in the Sa&#xef;s Basin. The biostratigraphic analyses based on the planktonic foraminifera of the boreholes studied reveals the succession of several biostratigraphic events, allowing us to attribute these sedimentary deposits to the late Tortonian - early Messinian time interval including the recognition of the T/M boundary. The abundance of continental inputs (pollen, spores, BOM, WOM, and COM in the palynofacies) and the low D/S ratio values indicated that the Sa&#xef;s basin was a neritic epicontinental environment suffering a significant influence of terrigenous inputs. The temperature index shows that the thermal conditions of the surface water were warm.

Mitochondrial DNA was successfully extracted and amplified from 42 out of 45 first vertebra from ancient hake and phylogenetic analysis assigned all haplotypes to Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi). According to osteometry, the Argentine hake recovered from the archaeological site were likely adults ranging 37.2-58.1&#xa0;cm in standard length. C and N stable isotope analysis showed that currently Argentine hake use foraging grounds deeper than those of Patagonian blenny and pink cusk-eel. Argentine hake, however, had a much broader isotopic niche during the Middle Holocene, when a large part of the population foraged much shallower than contemporary pink cusk-eel. The overall evidence suggests the presence of large numbers of Argentine hake onshore Tierra del Fuego during the Middle Holocene, which allowed exploitation by hunter-gatherer-fisher groups devoid of fishing technology.

In both observations and models, spatial patterns in ecosystem responses to hydroclimate variability are strongly governed by ecosystem sensitivity rather than climate exposure.

Plant traits play a central role in determining ecosystem properties, therefore we investigated how the onset of agriculture in Europe changed plant trait composition using 78 pollen records.

We estimate an overall four-fold decrease in plant size through agriculture and associated decreases in leaf and seed size. We show an increase in niche space towards the resource-acquisitive end of the leaf economic spectrum.

Identifying the domestic species (alpaca and llama) in archaeological sites based solely on morphological data is challenging due to their similarity with respect to their wild ancestors. Using genetic methods also presents challenges due to the hybridization history of the domestic species, which are thought to have extensively hybridized following the Spanish conquest of South America that resulted in camelids slaughtered en masse. In this study, we generated mitochondrial genomes for 61 ancient South American camelids dated between 3,500 and 2,400 years before the present (Early Formative period) from two archaeological sites in Northern Chile (Tul&#xe1;n-54 and Tul&#xe1;n-85), as well as 66 modern camelid mitogenomes and 815 modern mitochondrial control region sequences from across South America.

By contrast 75 or more species including at least ten liverworts were recovered as subfossils frozen in, on and around the Iceman from before, at and after his time. About two thirds of the species grow in the nival zone (above 3,000m above sea level) now while about one third do not. A large part of this third can be explained by the Iceman having both deliberately and inadvertently carried bryophytes during his last, fatal journey.

Spherulites were present throughout the entire sequence in varying concentrations. Using a new method to quantify spherulites, exclusion criteria were developed to eliminate samples possibly contaminated with modern dung, strengthening observations of ancient human behavior. Darkened spherulites within an Epipalaeolithic 1B firepit (12,800-12,300 calBP) indicate burning between 500-700&#xb0;C, documenting early use of dung fuel by hunter-gatherers as a supplement to wood, coeval with a dramatic shift to rectilinear architecture, increasing proportions of wild sheep and aurochsen, reduced emphasis on small game, and elevated dung concentrations immediately outside the 1B dwelling. Combined, these observations suggest that small numbers of live animals (possibly wild sheep) were tended on-site by Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherers to supplement gazelle hunting, raising the question of whether early experiments in animal management emerged contemporaneously with, or pre-date, cultivation. Dung was used to prepare plaster floors during the Neolithic and continued to be burned as a supplemental fuel, indicating that spherulites were deposited via multiple human- and animal-related pathways. This has important implications for interpretations of archaeobotanical assemblages across the region. Spherulite concentrations dropped abruptly during Neolithic 2B (9,300-8,000 calBP) and 2C (8,000-7,800 calBP), when sheep/goat herding surpassed gazelle hunting, possibly corresponding with movement of animals away from the site as herd sizes increased.

The application of predictive algorithms using archaeological and paleoenvironmental data allows one to estimate the ecological niches occupied by past human populations and identify niche changes through time, thus providing the possibility of investigating relationships between cultural innovations and possible niche shifts. By using such methods to examine two key southern Africa archaeological cultures, the Still Bay [76-71 thousand years before present (ka)] and the Howiesons Poort (HP; 66-59 ka), we identify a niche shift characterized by a significant expansion in the breadth of the HP ecological niche.

The origins and production patterns of large bifacial cutting tools ('LCTs') - the marker of the Acheulean techno-complex - and the systematic changes in this behaviour through time are gaining increasing interest in paleoanthropology. Here we provide a synthesis of early Acheulean LCT variation in a landscape context by analysing assemblages from four different quasi-contemporaneous (&#x223c;1.4&#xa0;Ma) sites from the Koobi Fora Formation. We characterize this variation using both 3D geometric morphometric and descriptive approaches. The expansive lateral exposures of fluvial and lacustrine sediments, as well as the associated tephrostratigraphy of the Koobi Fora Formation provide the landscape context that enables these comparative analyses. Our study demonstrates that when multiple contemporaneous early Acheulean localities are analysed together, a broader picture of LCT variability is elucidated. Four sites at Koobi Fora appear to represent a single system of lithic economy, characterized by a discrete trajectory of changes in LCT size and shape. These sites have ranges of LCT forms which appear to represent different but overlapping stages on a single reduction trajectory. Certain sites exhibit the full reduction trajectory while others exhibit only fragments of this trajectory. Other inter-site lithic proxies further complement these patterns in LCT variability.

Polar bears' elongated skulls and reduced molar dentition, as compared to their sister species the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), are adaptations associated with hunting seals on sea ice and a soft, lipid-rich diet of blubber and meat. With significant declines in sea ice, it is unclear if and how polar bears may be altering their diets. Clarifying polar bear dietary responses to changing climates, both today and in the past, is critical to proper conservation and management of this apex predator. This is particularly important when a dietary strategy may be maladaptive. Here, we test the hypothesis that hard-food consumption (i.e., less preferred foods including bone), inferred from dental microwear texture analysis, increased with Arctic warming. We find that polar bears demonstrate a conserved absence of hard-object feeding in Alaska through time (including approximately 1000&#xa0;years ago), until the 21st century, consistent with a highly conserved and specialized diet of soft blubber and flesh. Notably, our results also suggest that some 21st-century polar bears may be consuming harder foods (e.g., increased carcass utilization, terrestrial foods including garbage), despite having skulls and metabolisms poorly suited for such a diet. Prior to the 21st century, only polar bears with larger mandibles demonstrated increased hard-object feeding, though to a much lower degree than closely related grizzly bears which regularly consume mechanically challenging foods. Polar bears, being morphologically specialized, have biomechanical constraints which may limit their ability to consume mechanically challenging diets, with dietary shifts occurring only under the most extreme scenarios.

Following the arrival of Neolithic groups in the 6th millennium BCE, the Northern Dongola Reach of Upper Nubia witnessed a cultural florescence manifested through elaborate funerary traditions. However, despite the wealth of archaeological data available from funerary contexts, including evidence for domesticated animals and plants as grave goods, the paucity of stratified habitation contexts hinders interpretation of local subsistence trajectories. While it is recognised archaeologically that, against the backdrop of increasing environmental deterioration, the importance of agriculture based on Southwest Asian winter cereals increased throughout the Kerma period (2500-1450 BCE), the contribution of domesticated cereals to earlier Neolithic herding economies remains unclear. This paper presents direct dietary data from a total of 55 Middle Neolithic and Kerma period individuals from Kadruka 21 and Kadruka 1. Microbotanical data obtained from human dental calculus and grave sediments are integrated with human and faunal stable isotopes to explore changes in dietary breadth over time. The combined results demonstrate the consumption of wild plant species, including C4 wetland adapted grasses, by Middle Neolithic individuals at Kadruka 1. Despite existing evidence for domesticated barley in associated graves, the results obtained in this study provide no clear evidence for the routine consumption of domesticated cereals by Middle Neolithic individuals. Rather, direct microparticle evidence for the consumption of Triticeae cereals is only associated with a single Kerma period individual and corresponds with an isotopic shift indicating a greater contribution of C3-derived resources to diet.

While only millets were eventually domesticated in early sedentary societies there, recent archaeobotanical evidence reported here indicates that grasses from the Paniceae (including millets) and Triticeae tribes were exploited together by foraging groups from the Last Glacial Maximum to the mid-Holocene. Here we explore how and why millets were selected for domestication while Triticeae were abandoned. We document the different exploitation and cultivation trajectories of the two tribes employing ancient starch data derived from nine archaeological sites dating from 25,000 to 5500&#x2009;cal BP (LGM through mid-Holocene) in North China. With this diachronic overview, we can place the trajectories into the context of paleoclimatic reconstructions for this period. Entering the Holocene, climatic changes increased the yield stability, abundance, and availability of the wild progenitors of millets, with growing conditions increasingly favoring millets while becoming more unfavorable for grasses of the Triticeae tribe. We thus hypothesize that climate change played a critical role in the selection of millet species for domestication in North China, with early domestication evidenced by 8700&#x2009;cal BP.",10.1038/s41598-018-26218-6,29777204,Maybe Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:35:11.455130-04:00,No,,

As dwarf birch is a diploid species and downy tree birch a tetraploid species, their hybrids are triploid. In the introgression process, triploid hybrids, which are partially fertile, can backcross with the parental species, producing progenies comprising introgressed diploid, triploid and tetraploid plants. Triploid plants produce both normal triporate pollen (with three pores) and abnormal, aborted pollen, due to dysfunctional meiosis. The type of pollen abnormality that can be detected and quantified is non-triporate pollen (with four or more pores in the pollen wall). We therefore used the presence of non-triporate pollen as a marker to trace birch hybridisation in the past. In the current study we examined fossil pollen in samples from Holocene sediments from three locations: Gr&#xed;msnes (SW), Eyjafj&#xf6;rdur (N) and Thistilsfj&#xf6;rdur (NE Iceland). All three peat monoliths had the starting age of 10.3&#xa0;cal. ka BP. Ages were calibrated based on known tephra layers and by radiocarbon dating. The size of Betula pollen grains was measured, and the species proportions calculated from size. Non-triporate grains were detected in samples from all three locations and throughout the Holocene, but with different frequencies. The peaks of intense hybridisation followed birch woodland expansion in two major periods of the Holocene, both coinciding with a warming of climate. The first period occurred in the Early Holocene, around 9.5-7&#xa0;cal. ka BP, when the climate warmed rapidly after deglaciation. The second period occurred around 5-3.5&#xa0;cal. ka BP, well within the mid-Holocene Northern Hemisphere warming. A new wave of birch hybridisation appears to have started in the last few decades as the climate has warmed. Birch woodlands are likely to become more widespread.

Its regional economic importance dates at least to the Early Bronze Age (~3600 BCE) and its cultivation contributed significantly to the culture and heritage of ancient civilizations in the region. In the southern Levant, pollen, pits and wood remains of wild olives (<i>O. europaea</i> subsp. <i>europaea</i> var. <i>sylvestris</i>) has been found in Middle Pleistocene sediments dating to approximately 780 kya, and are present in numerous palynological sequences throughout the Pleistocene and into the Holocene. Archeological evidence indicates the olive oil production from at least the Pottery Neolithic to Chalcolithic transition (~7600-7000 BP), and clear evidence for cultivation by, 7000 BP. It is hypothesized that olive cultivation began through the selection of local genotypes of the wild var. <i>sylvestris</i>. Local populations of naturally growing trees today have thus been considered wild relatives of the olive. However, millennia of cultivation raises questions about whether genuine populations of var. sylvestris remain in the region. Ancient olive landraces might thus represent an ancient genetic stock closer to the ancestor gene pool. This review summarizes the evidence supporting the theory that olives were first cultivated in the southern Levant and reviews our genetic work characterizing local ancient cultivars.

But, dominance by a single canopy species can also occur in tropical wet climates and can remain stable for centuries. These are uncommon globally, with the African wet tropics supporting more such communities than the Neotropics or Southeast Asia. Differences in regional evolutionary histories are implied by biogeography: most of Africa's monodominance-forming species are Amherstieae-tribe legumes; monodominance in Neotropical forests occur among diverse taxonomic groups, often legumes, but rarely Amherstieae, and monodominance in Southeast Asian forests occurs mostly among Dipterocarpaceae species.

In this study, we use plant macrofossils and analysis of fossil pollen and spores from the Western Desert, Egypt, to assess temporal changes in plant communities during the Cenomanian. The investigated strata have relatively diverse sporomorph assemblages, which reflect the nature of parent vegetation. Specifically, the palynofloras represent ferns, conifers, monosulcate pollen producers, Gnetales, and a diverse group of angiosperms. Comparisons of both, dispersed palynoflora and plant macrofossils reveal different characteristics of the palaeoflora owing to a plethora of taphonomical and ecological biases including the depositional environment, production levels, and discrepancies between different plant organs. A combination of detailed records of sporomorphs, leaves, and charcoal from the studied successions provide new understandings of the palaeoclimate and palaeogeography during the Cenomanian and Albian-Cenomanian transition in Egypt. The mixed composition of the palynofloral assemblages reflects the presence of different depositional situations with a weak marine influence, as evidenced by a minor dinoflagellate cysts component. The local vegetation comprised various categories including herbaceous groups including ferns and eudicots, fluvial, open environments, and xeric arboreal communities dominated by Cheirolepidiaceae and perhaps including drought- and/or salt-tolerating ferns (Anemiaceae) and other gymnosperms (Araucariaceae, Ginkgoales, Cycadales, and Gnetales) as well as angiosperms. The presence of riparian and freshwater wetland communities favouring aquatic and/or hygrophilous ferns (of Salviniaceae and Marsileaceae), is noted. The wide variation of depositional settings derived from the palynological data may be attributed to a prevalent occurrence of producers in local vegetation during the early Cenomanian of Egypt.

The 50 years of pollen monitoring in Basel, Switzerland provide a unique opportunity to study long-term changes in pollen data. Since 1969, pollen monitoring has been carried out in Basel with a Hirst-type pollen trap. Pollen season parameters for start dates, end dates and duration were calculated with different pollen season definitions, which are commonly used in aerobiology. Intensity was analyzed by the annual pollen integral (APIn), peak value and the number of days above specific thresholds. Linear trends were calculated with the non-parametric Mann Kendall method with a Theil-Sen linear trend slope. During the last 50 years, linear increase of the monthly mean temperatures in Basel was 0.95-1.95&#xb0;C in the 3 winter months, 2-3.7&#xb0;C in spring months and 2.75-3.85&#xb0;C in summer months. Due to this temperature increase, the start dates of the pollen season for most of the spring pollen species have advanced, from 7 days for Poaceae to 29 days for <i>Taxus</i>/Cupressaceae. End dates of the pollen season depend on the chosen pollen season definition. Negative trends predominate, i.e., the pollen season mostly ends earlier. Trends in the length of the pollen season depend even more on the season definitions and results are contradictory and often not significant. The intensity of the pollen season of almost all tree pollen taxa increased significantly, while the Poaceae pollen season did not change and the pollen season of herbs decreased, except for Urticaceae pollen. Climate change has a particular impact on the pollen season, but the definitions used for the pollen season parameters are crucial for the calculation of the trends.

Comparing records of past vegetation change, and hominin evolution and development, with this breakpoint in the climate system is challenging owing to the paucity of study sites available and uncertainties regarding the dating of records. Notwithstanding these uncertainties we find that, broadly speaking, both vegetation and hominins change around 300 ka.

Our findings could not only provide new unique insight about the long-time-scale fire-human-climate-vegetation interactions and also provide reasonable guidance for fire management given current climate change in Central Asia.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155153,35413343,Maybe Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:15:00.751047-04:00,No,,

The aim of this study is to investigate the late Quaternary distribution of Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis) and to project future distribution ranges under different climate change scenarios using a combined palaeobotanical, phylogeographic, and modelling approach. Five species distribution modelling algorithms under the R-package `biomod2`were applied to occurrence data of Fagus orientalis to predict distributions under present, past (Last Glacial Maximum, 21 ka, Mid-Holocene, 6 ka), and future climatic conditions with different scenarios obtained from MIROC-ESM and CCSM4 global climate models. Distribution models were compared to palaeobotanical and phylogeographic evidence. Pollen data indicate northern Turkey and the western Caucasus as refugia for Oriental beech during the Last Glacial Maximum. Although pollen records are missing, molecular data point to Last Glacial Maximum refugia in northern Iran. For the mid-Holocene, pollen data support the presence of beech in the study region. Species distribution models predicted present and Last Glacial Maximum distribution of Fagus orientalis moderately well yet underestimated mid-Holocene ranges. Future projections under various climate scenarios indicate northern Iran and the Caucasus region as major refugia for Oriental beech. Combining palaeobotanical, phylogeographic and modelling approaches is useful when making projections about distributions of plants. Palaeobotanical and molecular evidence reject some of the model projections. Nevertheless, the projected range reduction in the Caucasus region and northern Iran highlights their importance as long-term refugia, possibly related to higher humidity, stronger environmental and climatic heterogeneity and strong vertical zonation of the forest vegetation.",10.1371/journal.pone.0242280,33201911,Maybe Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:13:42.389760-04:00,No,,

Birch trees (Betula spp.) are important sources of aeroallergens in Central and Northern Europe. Birches are vulnerable to climate change as these trees are sensitive to increased temperatures and summer droughts. This study aims to examine the effect of climate change on airborne birch pollen concentrations in Central Europe using Bavaria in Southern Germany as a case study. Pollen data from 28 monitoring stations in Bavaria were used in this study, with time series of up 30&#xa0;years long. An integrative approach was used to model airborne birch pollen concentrations taking into account drivers influencing birch tree abundance and birch pollen production and projections made according to different climate change and socioeconomic scenarios. Birch tree abundance is projected to decrease in parts of Bavaria at different rates, depending on the climate scenario, particularly in current centres of the species distribution. Climate change is expected to result in initial increases in pollen load but, due to the reduction in birch trees, the amount of airborne birch pollen will decrease at lower altitudes. Conversely, higher altitude areas will experience expansions in birch tree distribution and subsequent increases in airborne birch pollen in the future. Even considering restrictions for migration rates, increases in pollen load are likely in Southwestern areas, where positive trends have already been detected during the last three decades. Integrating models for the distribution and abundance of pollen sources and the drivers that control birch pollen production allowed us to model airborne birch pollen concentrations in the future.

Here, we report fossil leaves, fruit, and roots of <i>Trapa</i> and fruit of <i>Hemitrapa</i> from the late Eocene of Weinan, the Weihe Basin of central China. The fossil leaves are identified as a new species, <i>Trapa natanifolia</i> Z. C. Han et H. Jia sp. nov., which represents the earliest known record of a <i>Trapa</i> leaf fossil. It is remarkably similar to extant species of <i>Trapa</i>, mostly due to the unique inflated petiole structures found in both of them. While displaying prominent intergeneric differences, the incomplete fossil fruits are assigned to <i>Trapa</i> sp. indet. and <i>Hemitrapa</i> sp. indet. The former is the earliest fossil fruit record of <i>Trapa</i>, and the latter represents the earliest fossil record of <i>Hemitrapa</i> found in Asia. These new fossil discoveries suggest that the divergence of <i>Trapa</i> and <i>Hemitrapa</i> occurred at least by the late Eocene.

It focuses on a particular challenge of measuring climate with pollen: pollen's mobility. As scientists came to learn, pollen from some vegetation is more mobile than others. Pollen's differential mobility challenged regional climatic conclusions because of the potential mixing of pollen from various locations. To minimize the effects of this problem, pollen analysts sought to decrease the noise produced by highly local or foreign pollen. Yet, many ground-truthing and calibration methods were not available to pollen analysts because of the temporal separation between the observer and the object of interest. Instead, pollen analysts had to make spatial meaning out of fossil pollen using empirical studies of modern pollen, inferences from macrofossils and successional history, and applying statistical theories to fossil pollen data. Many of these corrections factors relied on pollen analysts' knowledge of place, including elements like the location's topography, prevailing winds, and plant cover. These elements were a natural part of vegetation-pollen-climate interactions. Scientists needed to account for them to turn pollen into a proxy for climate. Pollen's movement was equally natural, but scientists decided to eliminate some pollen to augment the regional climate signal. These selective eliminations of place suggest that not all elements of place are equally important. Scientists had to omit some elements of place to make sense of the complexities of the natural world.",10.1007/s10739-022-09677-6,35637366,Maybe Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:04:01.065596-04:00,No,,

In this study, we investigated pollen production of 17 birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) individuals along an altitudinal gradient in the European Alps. We sampled catkins at nine locations in the years 2020-2021 and monitored air temperatures. We investigated how birch pollen, flowers and inflorescences are produced in relation to thermal factors at various elevations. We found that mean pollen production of Betula pubescens Ehrh. varied between 0.4 and 8.3 million pollen grains per catkin.

Hotter and drier climates lead to longer and more severe wildland fire seasons, impairing air quality around the globe. Hotter temperatures lead to higher levels of ozone, and particles, causing the exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases and premature mortality. Longer pollen seasons and higher pollen levels provoke allergic airway diseases. In arid regions, accelerated land degradation and desertification are promoting dust pollution and impairing food production and nutritional content that are essential to respiratory health. Extreme weather events and flooding impede healthcare delivery and can lead to poor indoor air quality due to mold overgrowth. Climate and human activities that harm the environment and ecosystem may also affect the emergence and spread of viral infections including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and associated morbidity and mortality exacerbated by air pollution.

Here we explore the behavioral and physiological effects of the attractants isopentyl acetate and pollen patty upon A. tumida adults, and also investigate the mixture of attractants with repellent compounds, which were previously untested against A. tumida. Electroantennograms established sensitivity of A. tumida antennae to both attractants and all repellents with the exception of DEET, with antennae displaying greatest sensitivity to the repellent pyrrolidine. A walking-response olfactometer, designed specifically for A. tumida, was used for all behavioral experiments. It was found that both pollen patty and isopentyl acetate were attractive to A. tumida adults; conversely, mixes of attractants and repellent volatiles led to less attraction or avoidance of what was previously a significantly attractive source. Of all repellents tested, pyrrolidine was found to be the most repelling molecule, with significant avoidance of the attractive source at a 10&#xa0;mg treatment of pyrrolidine. The results of this study indicate that, at the behavioral level, the repellent compounds pyrrolidine and 1,4-dimethylpiperazine resulted in a negative preference index indicating a repellent behavioral response.

To evaluate impact of global warming on these organisms three different projections and four various climate change scenarios were analysed. The niche modelling was based on presence-only records of Limodorum abortivum, two species of Russula and three insects pollinating orchid (Anthophora affinis, Bombus terrestris, Rhodanthidium septemdentatum). Two sets of orchid predictions were examined-the first one included only climatic data and the second one was based on climate data and data on future distribution of orchid fungal symbionts. Overall, a poleward range shift is predicted to occur as a result of climate change and apparently global warming will be favorable for L. abortivum and its potential geographical range will expand. However, due to the negative effect of global warming on fungal symbionts of L. abortivum, the actual extension of the suitable niches of the orchid will be much limited. Considering future possibility of cross-pollination, the availability of A. affinis for L. abortivum will decrease and this bee will be available in the worst case scenarios only for 21% of orchid populations.

Most studies have compared antagonistic plant-herbivore interactions of domesticated plants and their wild relatives, but little attention has been given to how domestication influences plant-pollinator interactions. Floral attributes and interactions of floral visitors were compared between sister taxa of the genus Cucurbita (Cucurbitaceae), the domesticated C. moschata, C. argyrosperma ssp. argyrosperma and its wild progenitor C. argyrosperma ssp. sororia in the place of origin. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to compare floral morphological traits and analyzed floral reward (nectar and pollen) quantity and quality between flowers of wild and domesticated cucurbits. Staminate and pistillate flowers of all three taxa were video recorded, and visitation and behavior of floral visitors were registered and analyzed. Most floral morphological characteristics of flowers of domesticated taxa were larger in both staminate and pistillate flowers. Staminate and pistillate flowers presented distinct correlations between floral traits and integration indices between domesticated and wild cucurbits. Additionally, pollen quantity and protein to lipid ratio were greater in domesticated cucurbits. Cucurbit pollen specialists, Eucera sp., had the highest probability of visit for all cucurbit taxa. We provide evidence that floral traits of domesticated and wild cucurbit plants experienced different selection pressures. Domesticated cucurbit plants may have more resources invested towards floral traits, thereby increasing attractiveness to pollinators and potentially plant reproductive success.

In the present study, after observing the correlation between the development of the pollen mother cells (PMCs) and the length of the buds, 28-31 mm long buds were selected as the experimental material, which were at the stage of prophase I-metaphase I. Individual buds were induced at different temperatures (40 &#xb0;C, 42 &#xb0;C, and 44 &#xb0;C) and durations (4 h and 6 h) using self-made multiwire heating equipment, and successfully induced fertile male gametes.. The best results were achieved with treatment of 42 &#xb0;C for 4 h, reaching a maximum fertile pollen induction rate of 36.64%, while bud mortality was 40%. Two chemicals, colchicine and oryzalin, were also used by injection, and only the treatment with oryzalin obtained fertile gametes, with the highest fertile gamete rate of 15.39% at a concentration of 0.005%, while the bud mortality was 36.67%. This suggests that high temperatures have a superior effect on lily 2n gamete induction. In addition, the pollen obtained from the 6 h induction of high temperature was significantly larger than that from the 4 h induction, with an average diameter of 138.64 &#x3bc;m and 107.88 &#x3bc;m, respectively, 2.35 and 1.84 times wider than haploid pollen. The fertile pollen was crossed with four cultivars and two species, and a total of 267 embryonic seeds were obtained, with the highest embryonic rate of 4.52% in OT lily 'Mister Cas' as the parent, which had a germination rate of 26.27%. This suggests that the method of high-temperature induction for fertile gametes probably has important significance for ploidy and distant hybrid breeding in lilies.",10.3390/plants12071563,37050189,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:10:10.065842-04:00,No,,

On the other hand, SE represents a valuable model system for studies on cell reprogramming, totipotency acquisition, and embryogenic development. The molecular mechanisms that govern the transition of plant somatic cells to embryogenic cells are largely unknown. There is increasing evidence that auxins mediate this transition and play a key role in somatic embryo development, although data on woody species are very limited. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics and possible role of endogenous auxin during SE in cork oak (<i>Quercus suber</i> L.). The auxin content was low in somatic cells before cell reprogramming, while it increased after induction of embryogenesis, as revealed by immunofluorescence assays. Cellular accumulation of endogenous auxin was also detected at the later stages of somatic embryo development. These changes in auxin levels correlated with the expression patterns of the auxin biosynthesis (<i>QsTAR2</i>) and signaling (<i>QsARF5</i>) genes, which were upregulated after SE induction. Treatments with the inhibitor of auxin biosynthesis, kynurenine, reduced the proliferation of proembryogenic masses and impaired further embryo development. <i>QsTAR2</i> and <i>QsARF5</i> were downregulated after kynurenine treatment.

The promoters of the identified genes contain many elements associated with stress responses, including response to abscisic acid, low-temperature, and methyl jasmonate. The expression levels of <i>BrHMP14</i>, <i>BrHMP16</i>, <i>BrHMP32</i>, <i>BrHMP41</i>, and <i>BrHMP42</i> were upregulated under Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and Pb<sup>2+</sup> stresses. <i>BrHMP06</i>, <i>BrHMP30</i>, and <i>BrHMP41</i> were also significantly upregulated after drought treatment.

We observed increased <i>BrHMP36</i> expression during the self-incompatibility (SI) response and decreased expression in the compatible pollination (CP) response during pollen-stigma interactions. These changes in expression suggest functions for these genes in HMPs include participating in heavy metal transport, detoxification, and response to abiotic stresses, with the potential for functions in sexual reproduction. We found potential co-functional partners of these key players by protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and found that some of the predicted protein partners are known to be involved in corresponding stress responses. Finally, phosphorylation investigation revealed many phosphorylation sites in BrHMPs, suggesting post-translational modification may occur during the BrHMP-mediated stress response.

After 21 d, the chickens remained in their treatment groups and fed standard grower diet. The results of the current study revealed that BP inclusion had positively improved (P &lt; 0.05) average weekly feed intake (FI), body weight (BW), body weight gain (BWG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in both sexes. However, the apparent nutrient digestibility, metabolizable energy (ME), and nutrient digestibility were not affected by the dietary BP. Furthermore, carcass yield in both sexes was improved (P &lt; 0.05) by BP inclusion levels. In contrast, meat pH, shear force, and sensory evaluation in both sexes were not affected (P &gt; 0.05). The results suggest that the broiler chicks can utilize bioactive compounds in BP when supplemented in the starter diets and subsequently improve their growth parameters throughout the growing period as well as carcass yield at slaughter age. These positive improvements could be due to high quality amino acids, essential oils, vitamins, and minerals of BP. Therefore, it is concluded that BP inclusion level of 12 g/kg or more in the starter diets could have positive effects on growth performance and carcass yield at slaughter age without causing adverse effects on meat physico-chemical properties and sensory evaluation in both male and female broiler chickens.",10.1016/j.psj.2023.102628,37043957,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:47:45.487904-04:00,No,,

An insect needs to visit a flower, receive pollen from the anthers, move to another conspecific flower, and finally deposit the pollen on a receptive stigma. Each of these steps may be affected by climate change, and focusing on only one of them (e.g., flower visitation) may miss important signals of change in service provision. In this study, we combine data on visitation, pollen transport, and single-visit pollen deposition to estimate functional outcomes in the high Arctic plant-pollinator network of Zackenberg, Northeast Greenland, a model system for global warming-associated impacts in pollination services. Over two decades of rapid climate warming, we sampled the network repeatedly: in 1996, 1997, 2010, 2011, and 2016. Although the flowering plant and insect communities and their interactions varied substantially between years, as expected based on highly variable Arctic weather, there was no detectable directional change in either the structure of flower-visitor networks or estimated pollen deposition. For flower-visitor networks compiled over a single week, species phenologies caused major within-year variation in network structure despite consistency across years. Weekly networks for the middle of the flowering season emerged as especially important because most pollination service can be expected to be provided by these large, highly nested networks. Our findings suggest that pollination ecosystem service in the high Arctic is remarkably resilient. This resilience may reflect the plasticity of Arctic biota as an adaptation to extreme and unpredictable weather. However, most pollination service was contributed by relatively few fly taxa (Diptera: <i>Spilogona sanctipauli</i> and <i>Drymeia segnis</i> [Muscidae] and species of <i>Rhamphomyia</i> [Empididae]). If these key pollinators are negatively affected by climate change, network structure and the pollination service that depends on it would be seriously compromised.",10.1002/ecm.1551,37035419,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:26:59.011570-04:00,No,,

This study investigated the role of flower rewards and pollinator specificity in the pollen transfer of a widely distributed member to the euglossinophilous Vanilla clade, V.&#xa0;pompona Schiede using data collected from Brazilian populations. These included investigations on morphology, light microscopy and histochemistry, and analysis of flowers scent using GC-MS. The pollinators and the mechanisms of pollination were recorded through focal observations. The yellow flowers of V. pompona are fragrant and offer nectar as reward. The major volatile compound of the V. pompona scent, carvone oxide, shows convergent evolution in Eulaema-pollinated Angiosperms. The pollination system of V. pompona is not species-specific, but its flowers are strongly adapted to pollination by large Eulaema males. Pollination mechanism is based in a combination of perfume collection and nectar seeking. The dogma of a species-specific pollination system based on food deception in Vanilla has been broken with the increase in studies on this Pantropical orchid genus. Here, least three bee species and dual reward-offering are involved in pollen transfer in V.&#xa0;pompona. Visitation frequency of bees collecting perfumes, used in courtship by male euglossines, is higher than in searching for food, as short-lived young euglossine males seem to be more interested in sex than food.

145,A simple and highly efficient strategy to induce both paternal and maternal haploids through temperature manipulation.,,,,,,Nature plants,Nat Plants,03,04,2023,"Haploid production by outcrossing with inducers is one of the key technologies to revolutionize breeding. A promising approach for developing haploid inducers is by manipulating centromere-specific histone H3 (CENH3/CENPA)<sup>1</sup>. GFP-tailswap, a CENH3-based inducer, induces paternal haploids at around 30% and maternal haploids at around 5% (ref. <sup>2</sup>). However, male sterility of GFP-tailswap makes high-demand maternal haploid induction more challenging. Our study describes a simple and highly effective method for improving both directions of haploid production. Lower temperatures dramatically enhance pollen vigour but reduce haploid induction efficiency, while higher temperatures act oppositely. Importantly, the effects of temperatures on pollen vigour and on haploid induction efficiency are independent. These features enable us to easily induce maternal haploids at around 24.8% by using pollen of inducers grown at lower temperatures to pollinate target plants, followed by switching to high temperatures for haploid induction. Moreover, paternal haploid induction can be simplified and enhanced by growing the inducer at higher temperatures pre- and post-pollination. Our findings provide new clues for developing and using CENH3-based haploid inducers in crops.",10.1038/s41477-023-01389-x,37012429,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:11:13.062636-04:00,No,,

It is well known that kinase-mediated phosphorylation inactivates ADF/cofilin. Here, however, we found that the activity of Arabidopsis ADF7 is enhanced by CDPK16-mediated phosphorylation. We found that CDPK16 interacts with ADF7 both in vitro and in vivo, and it enhances ADF7-mediated actin depolymerization and severing in vitro in a calcium-dependent manner. Accordingly, the rate of actin turnover is reduced in cdpk16 pollen and the amount of actin filaments increases significantly at the tip of cdpk16 pollen tubes. CDPK16 phosphorylates ADF7 at Serine128 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phospho-mimetic mutant ADF7S128D has enhanced actin-depolymerizing activity compared to ADF7. Strikingly, we found that failure in the phosphorylation of ADF7 at Ser128 impairs its function in promoting actin turnover in vivo, which suggests that this phospho-regulation mechanism is biologically significant.

Here, by genomic editing of all four Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ROPs that are preferentially expressed in pollen, we showed that ROPs are essential for polarity establishment during pollen germination. We further identified and characterized two ROP effectors in pollen germination (REGs) through genome-wide interactor screening, Boundary of ROP domain (BDR) members BDR8 and BDR9, whose functional loss also resulted in no pollen germination. BDR8 and BDR9 were distributed in the cytosol and the vegetative nucleus of mature pollen grains but re-distributed to the plasma membrane (PM) of the germination site and to the apical PM of growing pollen tubes. We demonstrated that the PM re-distribution of BDR8 and BDR9 during pollen germination relies on ROPs but not vice versa. Furthermore, enhanced expression of BDR8 partially restored germination of rop1 pollen but had no effects on that of the quadruple rop pollen, supporting their genetic epistasis.

The Pleistocene overkill hypothesis imagined human hunting, not climate change, to be the primary cause of megafaunal extinction. This article situates the Pleistocene overkill hypothesis in a broader history of the emergence of historical ecology as a distinct sub-discipline of paleoecology. Tracing the work of the Yale Geochronometric Laboratory and an interdisciplinary research network that included Paul Sears, Richard Foster Flint, Edward Deevey, Kathryn Clisby, and Paul S.

First used as a tool for fossil fuel extraction, fossil pollen became a means of envisioning climatic history, and ultimately, a means of reimagining global ecological history. First through pollen stratigraphy and then through radiocarbon dating, ecologists reconstructed past biotic communities and rethought the role of humans in these communities.

Climate change also affects extreme atmospheric events such as heat waves, droughts, thunderstorms, floods, cyclones and hurricanes. These climate events, in particular thunderstorms during pollen seasons, can increase the intensity of asthma attacks in pollinosis patients. Climate change has important effects on the start and pathogenetic aspects of hypersensitivity of pollen allergy. Climate change causes an increase in the production of pollen and a change in the aspects increasing their allergenic properties. Through the effects of climate change, plant growth can be altered so that the new pollen produced are modified affecting more the human health. The need for public education and adoption of governmental measures to prevent environmental pollution and climate change are urgent. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, chemical and biologic contributors to air pollution are of critical importance. Extreme weather phenomena such as thunderstorms can trigger exacerbations of asthma attacks and need to be prevented with a correct information and therapy.",10.1097/MOP.0000000000001237,36917187,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:18:21.459258-04:00,No,,

PLA<sub>2</sub> produces free fatty acids and lysophospholipids, which regulate several physiological functions, including lipid metabolism, plant growth and development, signal transduction, and response to various environmental stresses. In the present work, we have performed a comparative analysis of PA2c domain-containing genes across plants, focusing on gene distribution, phylogenetic analysis, tissue-specific expression, and homology modeling. Our data revealed the widespread occurrence of multiple sPLA<sub>2</sub> in most land plants and documented single sPLA<sub>2</sub> in multiple algal groups, indicating an ancestral origin of sPLA<sub>2</sub>. We described a novel PA2c-containing gene family present in all plant lineages and lacking secretory peptide, which we termed PLA<sub>2</sub>-like. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two independent clades in canonical sPLA<sub>2</sub> genes referred to as &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; clades, whereas PLA<sub>2</sub>-like genes clustered independently as a third clade. Further, we have explored clade-specific gene expressions showing that while all three clades were expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues, only sPLA<sub>2</sub>-&#x3b2; and PLA<sub>2</sub>-like members were expressed in the pollen and pollen tube. To get insight into the conservation of the gene regulatory network of sPLA<sub>2</sub> and PLA<sub>2</sub>-like genes, we have analyzed the occurrence of various cis-acting promoter elements across the plant kingdom. The comparative 3D structure analysis revealed conserved and unique features within the PA2c domain for the three clades.

Because grasses are largely wind-pollinated, it was thought that pollinators would not forage on turfgrasses. Centipede grass (<i>Eremochloa ophiuroides</i> (Munro) Hack) is a warm-season turfgrass widely used in the southeastern USA. Centipede grass produces spike-like inflorescences from August to October, and little is known about whether pollinators utilize those inflorescences as pollen resources. Thus, the objective of the current study was to identify the pollinators foraging on centipede grass inflorescences. Pollinator samples were collected by (1) sweeping the insects actively foraging on centipede grass inflorescence for 30 min, (2) deploying pan traps for 24 h and (3) deploying malaise traps for 7 d. In the sweep samples, <i>Lasioglossum</i> spp., <i>Bombus</i> spp., <i>Apis</i> spp., <i>Melissodes</i> spp. and <i>Augochlorella</i> spp. were collected from centipede grass inflorescences.

An important aspect of this study is birch pollen, which is a problem for allergy sufferers, and due to a variety of environmental conditions, its allergenicity may increase. Among the organs studied, inflorescences deserve attention, which, as seen from an overview of the literature, are analysed for the content of heavy metals for the first time in this study. This paper investigated the relationship between antioxidant properties and the content of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni and Cr) as the plant's response to stress, taking into account both the vegetative and generative organs of the tree Betula pendula. While studying the accumulation of elements in individual organs, the research was extended to include the aspect of different environmental conditions, reflected in two soil types of differing physicochemical properties: sandy and silty soils. In order to thoroughly analyse the transport of the studied heavy metals from the soil to individual organs (leaves, inflorescences and pollen), ecotoxicological indicators were used. A modified translocation factor (TF) index into sTF (sap translocation factor) was presented as a novelty in research, calculated based on the content of selected heavy metals in the sap flowing to individual birch organs. This allowed for a more complete description of the transport of elements in the aerial parts of plants, indicating the accumulation of zinc and cadmium, especially in leaves. Among the studied environmental conditions which may affect the accumulation of heavy metals, sandy soil is of particular significance, conditioning lower pH values, among other things. However, analysis of the reaction of birch to the conditions of the soil environment and the content of heavy metals, based on antioxidant properties, demonstrated an evident reaction to stress, but without an unambiguous response among the studied vegetative and generative organs. As birch is a plant with wide utility values, monitoring studies are advisable to exclude the risk of accumulation of heavy metals in its organs, and for this purpose it may be useful to use the sTF indicator and assess the antioxidant potential.",10.1186/s13036-022-00322-8,36879267,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:07:59.446415-04:00,No,,

However, despite their importance our knowledge of the proteins underlying Triticeae reproduction is severely lacking and this is not only true of pollen and stigma development, but also of their pivotal interaction. When the pollen grain and stigma are brought together they have each accumulated the proteins required for their intended meeting and accordingly studying their mature proteomes is bound to reveal proteins involved in their diverse and complex interactions. Using triticale as a Triticeae representative, gel-free shotgun proteomics was used to identify 11,533 and 2977 mature stigma and pollen proteins respectively. These datasets, by far the largest to date, provide unprecedented insights into the proteins participating in Triticeae pollen and stigma development and interactions. The study of the Triticeae stigma has been particularly neglected. To begin filling this knowledge gap, a developmental iTRAQ analysis was performed revealing 647 proteins displaying differential abundance as the stigma matures in preparation for pollination. An in-depth comparison to an equivalent Brassicaceae analysis divulged both conservation and diversification in the makeup and function of proteins involved in the pollen and stigma encounter. SIGNIFICANCE: Successful pollination brings together the mature pollen and stigma thus initiating an intricate series of molecular processes vital to crop reproduction. In the Triticeae crops (e.g. wheat, barley, rye, triticale) there persists a vast deficit in our knowledge of the proteins involved which needs to be addressed if we are to face the many upcoming challenges to crop production such as those associated with climate change. At maturity, both the pollen and stigma have acquired the protein complement necessary for their forthcoming encounter and investigating their proteomes will inevitably provide unprecedented insights into the proteins enabling their interactions. By combining the analysis of the most comprehensive Triticeae pollen and stigma global proteome datasets to date with developmental iTRAQ investigations, proteins implicated in the different phases of pollen-stigma interaction enabling pollen adhesion, recognition, hydration, germination and tube growth, as well as those underlying stigma development were revealed. Extensive comparisons between equivalent Triticeae and Brassiceae datasets highlighted both the conservation of biological processes in line with the shared goal of activating the pollen grain and promoting pollen tube invasion of the pistil to effect fertilization, as well as the significant distinctions in their proteomes consistent with the considerable differences in their biochemistry, physiology and morphology.",10.1016/j.jprot.2023.104867,36870675,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:19:30.803393-04:00,No,,

Such an approval went into effect in 2021 for TMX-coated sugar beet seeds in Germany. Usually, this crop is harvested before flowering without exposing non-target organisms to the active ingredient or its metabolites. In addition to the approval, strict mitigation measures were imposed by the EU and the German federal states. One of the measures was to monitor the drilling of sugar beet and its impact on the environment. Hence we took residue samples from different bee and plant matrices and at different dates to fully map beet growth in the German states of Lower Saxony, Bavaria, and Baden-W&#xfc;rttemberg. A total of four treated and three untreated plots were surveyed, resulting in 189 samples. Residue data were evaluated using the US Environmental Protection Agency BeeREX model to assess acute and chronic risk to honey bees from the samples, because oral toxicity data are widely available for both TMX and CLO. Within treated plots, we found no residues either in pools of nectar and honey crop samples (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;24) or dead bee samples (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21). Although 13% of beebread and pollen samples and 88% of weed and sugar beet shoot samples were positive, the BeeREX model found no evidence of acute or chronic risk. We also detected neonicotinoid residues in the nesting material of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis, probably from contaminated soil of a treated plot. All control plots were free of residues. Currently, there are insufficient data on wild bee species to allow for an individual risk assessment.

While most eukaryotic genomes encode two APEs, plants usually possess three APEs, namely APE1L, APE2, and ARP. To date, the biological relevance and functional divergence of plant APEs are unclear. Here, we show that the three plant APEs have ancient origins, with the APE1L clade being plant-specific. In Arabidopsis thaliana, simultaneously mutating APE1L and APE2, but not ARP alone or in combination with either APE1L or APE2, results in clear developmental defects linked to genotoxic stress. Genetic analyses indicated that the three plant APEs have different substrate preferences in vivo. ARP is mainly responsible for AP site repair, while APE1L and APE2 prefer to repair 3' blocked single-stranded DNA breaks. We further determined that APEs play an important role in DNA repair and the maintenance of genomic integrity in meiotic cells. The ape1l ape2 double mutant exhibited a greatly enhanced frequency of SPO11-1-dependent and -independent double-strand DNA breaks. The DNA damage response was activated in ape1l ape2 to trigger pollen abortion.

Dormancy is divided into three sequential phases: paradormancy, endodormancy and ecodormancy. During the winter, buds need cultivar-specific chilling requirements (CRs) to overcome endodormancy and heat requirements to activate the machinery to flower in the ecodormancy phase. One of the main factors that enables the transition from endodormancy to ecodormancy is transcriptome reprogramming. In this work, we therefore monitored three almond cultivars with different CRs and flowering times by RNA sequencing during the endodormancy release of flower buds and validated the data by quantitative real-time PCR in two consecutive seasons. We were thus able to identify early and late flowering time candidate genes in endodormant and ecodormant almond flower buds associated with metabolic switches, transmembrane transport, cell wall remodeling, phytohormone signaling and pollen development.

The lipids in royal jelly come from the bee pollen consumed by honeybees, and different plant source of bee pollen affects the lipid composition of royal jelly. However, the effect of bee pollen consumption on the lipid composition of royal jelly remains unclear. Herein, we examined the influence of two factors on the lipid composition of royal jelly: first, two plant sources of bee pollen, i.e., <i>Acer mono</i> Maxim.

Lipidomic analyses were conducted on the royal jelly produced by honeybees fed BP-Am or BP-Pa using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The results showed that the phospholipid and fatty acid contents differed in royal jelly produced by honeybees fed BP-Am compared to those fed BP-Pa. There were also differences between timepoints, with many lipid compounds decreasing in abundance soon after single-pollen feeding began, slowly increasing over time, then decreasing again after 30 days of single-pollen feeding. The single bee pollen diet destroyed the nutritional balance of bee colonies and affected the development of hypopharyngeal and maxillary glands, resulting in differences in royal jelly quality.

The feeding of those insects depends on the spatial and temporal distribution of nectar and pollen as food resource. Hence, to protect insect biodiversity, a spatio-temporal assessment of food quantity of their habitats is necessary. Therefore, sufficient data on traits of floral resources are required. As floral resources' traits of plants are important to quantify food availability, we present two databases, the FloRes Database (Floral Resources Database) and the raw database, from where FloRes was derived. Both databases contain the plant traits: (1) flowering period, (2) floral-unit density per day, (3) nectar volume per floral unit per day, (4) sugar content per floral unit, (5) sugar concentration in nectar, (6) pollen mass or volume per floral unit and per day, (7) protein content of pollen and (8) corolla depth. All traits were sampled from literature and online databases. The raw database consists of 702 specified plant species, 138 unspecified species 37 species (spec., sp), 22 species <i>pluralis</i> (spp) and, for 79, only the genus was identified) and two species complexes (agg.). Those 842 taxa belong to 488 genera and 102 families. Finally, only 27 taxa have a complete set of traits, too few for a sufficient assessment of spatio-temporal availability of floral food-resources.As information on floral resources is scattered throughout many publications with different units, we also present our multistep workflow implemented in five consecutive R-scripts. The multistep workflow standardises the trait units of the raw database to comparable entities with identical units and aggregates them on a reasonable taxonomic level into the second application database, the FloRes Database. Finally, the FloRes Database contains aggregated information of traits for 42 taxa and, when corolla depth is excluded, for 72 taxa.This is the first attempt to gather these eight traits from different literature sources into one database with a multistep workflow.

The present analysis evaluated the cost-utility of treating adults with AR with SQ Tree SLIT-Tablet versus placebo, both in combination with symptom-relieving medications, from a Swedish societal perspective. A model was developed to evaluate changes in cost and quality of life associated with using SQ Tree SLIT-Tablet relative to placebo in an adult population of individuals with AR. The model captured costs associated with symptom-relieving medications, healthcare professional interactions, SQ Tree SLIT-Tablet, and indirect costs arising from absenteeism and reduced workplace productivity. The analysis was conducted over 10 years with costs captured in 2021 Swedish Krona (SEK) and future costs and effects discounted at 3% per annum. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Treatment with SQ Tree SLIT-Tablet resulted in an improvement of 0.041 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 10 years versus placebo. From a Swedish societal perspective, costs increased by SEK 9077 over the same period, resulting in an incremental cost-utility ratio of SEK 223,445 per QALY gained.

This paper was also focused on selecting the best diagnostic features that would be used for future stigma analysis in other species of Orobanchaceae. These analyses were conducted with fresh, dry and fixed material using stereomicroscopy from different locations from Central Europe. Twenty-one quantitative or qualitative morphological features were analysed. This study highlights the variation of stigma morphology and characters which are useful to improve the taxonomic understanding of problematic taxa. Thus, two main types of stigmas were established, based on tested features: 1-oval, rarely hemispherical in shape, most often one-coloured with lobes separated in <i>Phelipanche</i> stigmas; 2-spherical to hemispherical, rarely oval, multi-coloured with partially fused or separated lobes in <i>Orobanche</i> stigmas.

We investigated the spatial variation of pollen deposition across eight sites and how the pollen receipt related to the seed set of <i>Salvia przewalskii</i>, a subalpine perennial herb in Hengduan Mountain in southwest China. We found that stigmatic pollen loads substantially varied among sites for several metrics, including quantities of conspecific and heterospecific pollen, the proportion of HP, and species composition of HP donors. Five different plant families were the most common HP source at one or two sites, and the proportion of HP ranged from 3.4% to 51.3% across sites. The association of conspecific pollen with seed set was positive and variable among sites, whereas the association of HP receipt and seed set was negative and not significantly different among sites.

The precise determination of the origin of seeds and their quantitative evaluation may elucidate inter-cytotype interactions, the potential role of mixed-cytotype populations in evolutionary success, and the long-term survival of some hybrid species. We investigated the reproduction modes of selected species of <i>Sorbus</i> in mixed-cytotype populations in eastern Slovakia, Central Europe.

The multivariate statistical treatment showed the contribution of certain pollen types in the extract of bee pollen as to phenols, flavonoids and antioxidant capacity. Specifically, the bee pollen samples with higher presence of Castanea, Erica, Lythrum and Campanula type indicated higher total phenol and flavonoid contents and antioxidant activities according to the principal component analysis. On the contrary, Plantago and Taraxacum officinale type contributed a lower content of these compounds and radical scavenging activity. The cluster analysis classified the bee pollen samples into three groups with significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) for the main pollen types, total phenol and flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacities. These results demonstrate the richness and botanical diversity in the pollen spectrum of bee pollen and enhance the possible beneficial nutraceutical properties of this beekeeping product.",10.3390/foods12020294,36673387,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:07:08.896132-04:00,No,,

Further, the advent of MPS now allows biological signatures to be obtained from complex DNA mixtures and trace amounts of low biomass samples. Environmental samples serve as ideal forms of contact trace evidence as detection at a scene can establish a link between a suspect, location and victim. Many studies have applied MPS technology to characterise the biodiversity within high biomass environmental samples (such as soil and water) to address questions related to ecology, conservation, climate change and human health. However, translation of these tools to forensic science remains in its infancy, due in part to the merging of traditional forensic ecology practices with unfamiliar DNA technologies and complex datasets. In addition, people and objects also carry low biomass environmental signals which have recently been shown to reflect a specific individual or location. The sensitivity, and reducing cost, of MPS is now unlocking the power of both high and low biomass environmental DNA (eDNA) samples as useful sources of genetic information in forensic science. This paper discusses the potential of eDNA to forensic science by reviewing the most explored applications that are leading the integration of this technology into the field. We introduce novel areas of forensic ecology that could also benefit from these tools with a focus on linking a suspect to a scene or establishing provenance of an unknown sample and discuss the current limitations and validation recommendations to achieve translation of eDNA into casework.",10.1016/j.fsigen.2020.102393,33157385,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:16:05.469437-04:00,No,,

In the current study, the microbial community structure of honey samples exerting pronounced antimicrobial activity was examined. The honey samples were obtained from different geographical locations in Greece and had diverse pollen origin (fir, cotton, fir-oak, and <i>Arbutus unedo</i> honeys). Identification of honey microbiota was performed by high-throughput amplicon sequencing analysis, detecting 335 distinct taxa in the analyzed samples. Regarding ecological indices, the fir and cotton honeys possessed greater diversity than the fir-oak and <i>Arbutus unedo</i> ones. <i>Lactobacillus kunkeei</i> (basionym of <i>Apilactobacillus kun-keei</i>) was the predominant taxon in the fir honey examined. <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. appeared to be favored in honey from fir-originated pollen and nectar since lactobacilli were more pronounced in fir compared to fir-oak honey. <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Lysobacter</i> and <i>Meiothermus</i> were the predominant taxa in cotton honey, whereas <i>Lonsdalea</i>, the causing agent of acute oak decline, and <i>Zymobacter</i>, an osmotolerant facultative anaerobic fermenter, were the dominant taxa in fir-oak honey. Moreover, methylotrophic bacteria represented 1.3-3% of the total relative abundance, independently of the geographical and pollen origin, indicating that methylotrophy plays an important role in honeybee ecology and functionality. A total of 14 taxa were identified in all examined honey samples, including bacilli/anoxybacilli, paracocci, lysobacters, pseudomonads, and sphingomonads. It is concluded that microbial constituents of the honey samples examined were native gut microbiota of melliferous bees and microbiota of their flowering plants, including both beneficial bacteria, such as potential probiotic strains, and animal and plant pathogens, e.g., <i>Staphylococcus</i> spp. and <i>Lonsdalea</i> spp. Further experimentation will elucidate aspects of potential application of microbial bioindicators in identifying the authenticity of honey and honeybee-derived products.",10.3390/antibiotics12010101,36671302,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:11:44.341208-04:00,No,,

In this paper, we use collagen mass fingerprinting and ancient DNA analysis of some of the first stratified and directly dated archaeofaunal assemblages from Mongolia's early pastoral cultures to undertake species identifications of this rare and highly fragmented material. Our results provide evidence for livestock-based, herding subsistence in Mongolia during the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia BCE. We observe no evidence for dietary exploitation of horses prior to the late Bronze Age, ca. 1200 BCE - at which point horses come to dominate ritual assemblages, play a key role in pastoral diets, and greatly influence pastoral mobility. In combination with the broader archaeofaunal record of Inner Asia, our analysis supports models for widespread changes in herding ecology linked to the innovation of horseback riding in Central Asia in the final 2nd millennium BCE. Such a framework can explain key broad-scale patterns in the movement of people, ideas, and material culture in Eurasian prehistory.",10.1038/s41598-020-57735-y,31969593,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:14:49.873764-04:00,No,,

Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,Theor Appl Genet,25,01,2023,"BrACOS5 mutations led to male sterility of Chinese cabbage verified in three allelic male-sterile mutants. Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis) is one of the major vegetable crops in East Asia, and the utilization of male-sterile line is an important measure for its hybrid seed production. Herein, we isolated three allelic male-sterile mutants, msm1-1, msm1-2 and msm1-3, from an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenized population of Chinese cabbage double-haploid (DH) line 'FT', whose microspores were completely aborted with severely absent exine, and tapetums were abnormally developed. Genetic analyses indicated that the three male-sterile mutants belonged to allelic mutation and were triggered by the same recessive nuclear gene. MutMap-based gene mapping and kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) analysis demonstrated that three different single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of BraA09g012710.3C were responsible for the male sterility of msm1-1/2/3, respectively. BraA09g012710.3C is orthologous of Arabidopsis thaliana ACOS5 (AT1G62940), encoding an acyl-CoA synthetase in sporopollenin biosynthesis, and specifically expressed in anther, so we named BraA09g012710.3C as BrACOS5. BrACOS5 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutations of BrACOS5 resulted in decreased enzyme activities and altered fatty acid contents in msm1 anthers. As well as the transcript accumulations of putative orthologs involved in sporopollenin biosynthesis were significantly down-regulated excluding BrPKSA. These results provide strong evidence for the integral role of BrACOS5 in conserved sporopollenin biosynthesis pathway and also contribute to uncovering exine development pattern and underlying male sterility mechanism in Chinese cabbage.",10.1007/s00122-023-04291-4,36656366,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:17:37.482066-04:00,No,,

The mechanisms underlying maternal inheritance are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that two independently acting mechanisms ensure maternal inheritance of the plastid (chloroplast) genome. Conducting large-scale genetic screens for paternal plastid transmission, we discovered that mild chilling stress during male gametogenesis leads to increased entry of paternal plastids into sperm cells and strongly increased paternal plastid transmission. We further show that the inheritance of paternal plastid genomes is controlled by the activity of a genome-degrading exonuclease during pollen maturation. Our data reveal that (1) maternal inheritance breaks down under specific environmental conditions, (2) an organelle exclusion mechanism and a genome degradation mechanism act in concert to prevent paternal transmission of plastid genes and (3) plastid inheritance is determined by complex gene-environment interactions.",10.1038/s41477-022-01323-7,36646831,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 17:54:58.917570-04:00,No,,

A review.,,,,,Climate change; Fertilization; Global rice production; Low yield; Pollination; Spikelet sterility,Heliyon,Heliyon,17,01,2023,"High-temperature stress (HS) has become an alarming threat to the global food system. Rice, an important crop that supports almost half of the global population, is vulnerable to heat stress. Under the influence of HS, it shows various physiological and morphological symptoms that increase spikelet sterility, reduce grain yield, and even cause total crop failure. HS affects growth and yield in two ways: hindrance in the process of pollination and fertilization and reduction of the grain weight. The former is caused by (i) distortion of floral organs, (ii) tapetum degeneration, (iii) low pollen protein concentration, (iv) decline in pollen viability, (v) reduction in dehiscence of anther, (vi) low pollen dispersal, (vii) decrease in number of pollens on stigma, (viii) reduction in pollen grain germination, (ix) hindrance in extension of pollen tubes, and (x) shrinkage of stigma which ultimately cause spikelet infertility. The latter is caused by (i)reduced photosynthetic rate, (ii) a boost in senescence of functional leaves, (iii) reduction of biological synthesis of starch, (iv)reduced starch augmentation, (v) shrunk duration of grain filling, and (vi) declined grain weight which ultimately reduce the grain yield. However, some agronomic and breeding approaches have been adopted for developing thermo-resistant cultivars but the success is limited.

This fossil represents the first record of Symplocaceae from Baltic amber and supports affinities of its flora to evergreen broadleaved and mixed mesophytic forests of present-day East and Southeast Asia.

Floral resource succession and spatial heterogeneity modulate plant-pollinator interactions across ecological scales (individual plant, local assemblage, and interaction network of agroecological infrastructure across the farm). Intraspecific variation in flowering phenology can modulate the precise level of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in floral resources, pollen donor density, and pollinator interactions that a plant individual is exposed to, thereby affecting reproduction. We tested how abiotic resources and multi-scale plant-pollinator interactions affected individual plant seed set modulated by intraspecific variation in flowering phenology and spatio-temporal floral heterogeneity arising from agroecological infrastructure. We transplanted two focal insect-pollinated plant species (<i>Cyanus segetum</i> and <i>Centaurea jacea</i>, <i>n</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;288) into agroecological infrastructure (10 sown wildflower and six legume-grass strips) across a farm-scale experiment (125&#x2009;ha). We applied an individual-based phenologically explicit approach to match precisely the flowering period of plant individuals to the concomitant level of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in plant-pollinator interactions, potential pollen donors, floral resources, and abiotic conditions (temperature, water, and nitrogen). Individual plant attractiveness, assemblage floral density, and conspecific pollen donor density (<i>C. jacea</i>) improved seed set. Network linkage density increased focal species seed set and modified the effect of local assemblage richness and abundance on <i>C. segetum</i>. Mutual dependence on pollinators in networks increased <i>C. segetum</i> seed set, while <i>C. jacea</i> seed set was greatest where both specialization on pollinators and mutual dependence was high. Abiotic conditions were of little or no importance to seed set. Intra- and interspecific plant-pollinator interactions respond to spatio-temporal heterogeneity arising from agroecological management affecting wild plant species reproduction. The interplay of pollinator interactions within and between ecological scales affecting seed set implies a co-occurrence of pollinator-mediated facilitative and competitive interactions among plant species and individuals.

In the last four decades, the discovery of cytoplasmic male-sterility (CMS) systems and the restoration of fertility (<i>Rf</i>) genes in <i>B. napus</i> has improved the crop traits by heterosis. The homologs of <i>Rf</i> genes, known as the restoration of fertility-like (<i>RFL</i>) genes, have also gained importance because of their similarities with <i>Rf</i> genes. Such as a high non-synonymous/synonymous codon replacement ratio (dN/dS), autonomous gene duplications, and a possible engrossment in fertility restoration. <i>B. napus</i> contains 53 <i>RFL</i> genes on chromosomes A9 and C8. Our research aims to study the function of <i>BnaRFL11</i> in fertility restoration using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique. A total of 88/108 (81.48%) T<sub>0</sub> lines, and for T<sub>1</sub>, 110/145 (75%) lines carried T-DNA insertions. Stable mutations were detected in the T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> generations, with an average allelic mutation transmission rate of 81%. We used CRISPR-P software to detect off-target 50 plants sequenced from the T<sub>0</sub> generation that showed no off-target mutation, signifying that if the designed sgRNA is specific for the target, the off-target effects are negligible. We also concluded that the mutagenic competence of the designed sgRNAs mediated by U6-26 and U6-29 ranged widely from 31% to 96%. The phenotypic analysis of <i>bnarfl11</i> revealed defects in the floral structure, leaf size, branch number, and seed production. We discovered a significant difference between the sterile line and fertile line flower development after using a stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscope. The pollen visibility test showed that the pollen grain had utterly degenerated. The cytological observations of homozygous mutant plants showed an anther abortion stage similar to nap-CMS, with a <i>Orf222</i>, <i>Orf139</i>, <i>Ap3</i>, and <i>nad5c</i> gene upregulation. The <i>bnarfl11</i> shows vegetative defects, including fewer branches and a reduced leaf size, suggesting that PPR-encoding genes are essential for the plants' vegetative and reproductive growth. Our results demonstrated that <i>BnaRFL11</i> has a possible role in fertility restoration.

Nitrogen and phosphorus are critical soil nutrients whose levels are altered by intensive land use that may affect plants' fitness via pollinator attractiveness through floral display and rewards. In a controlled greenhouse study, we studied in cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) how changes in soil nitrogen and phosphorus influence floral traits, including nectar and pollen reward composition. We evaluated how these traits affect bumble bee (Bombus impatiens, an important cucumber pollinator) visitation and ultimately fruit yield. While increasing nitrogen and phosphorus increased growth and floral display, excess nitrogen created an asymptotic or negative effect, which was mitigated by increasing phosphorus. Male floral traits exhibited higher plasticity in responses to changes in soil nutrients than female flowers. At 4:1 nitrogen:phosphorus ratios, male flowers presented increased nectar volume and pollen number resulting in increased bumble bee visitation. Interestingly, other pollinator rewards remained consistent across all soil treatments: male and female nectar sugar composition, female nectar volume, and pollen protein and lipid concentrations. Therefore, although cucumber pollination success was buffered in conditions of nutrient stress, highly skewed nitrogen:phosphorus soil ratios reduced plant fitness via reduced numbers of flowers and reward quantity, pollinator attraction, and ultimately yield.",10.1038/s41598-022-26164-4,36526706,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:03:21.227639-04:00,No,,

We monitored coflowering density and corresponding pollination patterns of the insect-pollinated palm <i>Oenocarpus bataua</i> in northwestern Ecuador and found that the influence of coflowering density on these patterns was scale dependent: high neighborhood densities were associated with reductions in pollen dispersal distance and gametic diversity of progeny arrays, whereas we observed the opposite pattern at the landscape scale. In addition, neighborhood coflowering density also impacted forward pollen dispersal kernel parameters, suggesting that low neighborhood densities encourage pollen movement and may promote gene flow and genetic diversity.

The infection of relevant tissues of seed embryo explants (SEEs) by <i>Agrobacterium</i> was improved by the centrifugation of the explants. Transgenic plants were obtained by multiple bud induction on high cytokinin media, followed by plant regeneration on hormone-free medium. Three different selectable markers (<i>cp4 epsps, aadA</i>, and <i>nptII</i>) were successfully used for producing transgenic plants. Stable integration of transgenes in the maize genome was demonstrated by molecular analyses and germline transmission of the inserted transgenes to the next generation was confirmed by pollen segregation and progeny analysis. Phenotypic evidence for chimeric transgenic tissue was frequently observed in initial experiments but was significantly reduced by including a second bud induction step with optimized cytokinin concentration. Additional improvements, including culturing explants at an elevated temperature during bud induction led to the development of a revolutionary system for efficient transgenic plant production and genome editing. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful transgenic plant regeneration through <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation of maize mature SEEs. This system starts with mature seed that can be produced in large volumes and the SEEs explants are storable.

These sub-pollen particles easily enter deep into human lungs, causing an asthmatic response named thunderstorm asthma (TA).

To overcome this problem, we have developed a physically-based pollen model (DREAM-POLL) with parameterized formation of airborne SPPs caused by convective atmospheric conditions. We ran the model over the Southern Australian grass fields for 2010 and 2016 pollen seasons when four largest decadal TA epidemics happened in Melbourne. One of these TA events (in November 2016) was the worldwide most extreme one which resulted to nine deaths and hundreds of hospital patient presentations. By executing the model on a day-by-day basis in a hindcast real-time mode we predicted SPP peaks exclusively only when the four major TA outbreaks happened, thus achieving a high forecasting success rate.

Currently, fertility restoration has been extensively investigated in crops, but fertility restoration of CMS wheat with Aegilops juvenalis cytoplasm is poorly understood. Here, a backcross population BC1F1 derived from a cross between the male-sterile line Ju706A, its maintainer line 706B, and restorer line LK783 was used to map the Rfd1 locus by bulked segregant analysis and wheat 660K single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. Ju706A displayed complete male sterility, and its fertility can be restored by LK783 with a pair of dominant genes Rfd1Rfd1. The locus was located to a 2.4 Mb region on chromosome 1BS by markers AX-174254104 and AX-111201011. Combined with transcriptomic analysis and quantitative real-time PCR assay, TraesCS1B02G197400LC, the most likely candidate gene for Rfd1, was found to encode a pectinesterase that was localized in the cell wall, and was highly expressed in fertile anthers. The silencing of Rfd1 resulted in decreased fertility, and heterogeneous expression of Rfd1 promoted pollen germination and affected vegetative growth. This implies that Rfd1 is required for anther or pollen development and male fertility in CMS wheat with Ae. juvenalis cytoplasm. Furthermore, a 7 bp deletion in Ju706A was employed to develop a specific marker, Xnwafu1, for molecular marker-assisted selection of restorers.

SLFs assemble into E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes known as Skp1-Cullin1-F-box complexes (SCFSLF). In pollen tubes, these complexes collectively mediate ubiquitination and degradation of all nonself S-RNases, but not self S-RNase, resulting in cross-compatible, but self-incompatible, pollination. Using Petunia inflata, we show that two pollen-expressed Cullin1 (CUL1) proteins, PiCUL1-P and PiCUL1-B, function redundantly in SI. This redundancy is lost in Petunia hybrida, not because of the inability of PhCUL1-B to interact with SSK1, but due to a reduction in the PhCUL1-B transcript level. This is possibly caused by the presence of a DNA transposon in the PhCUL1-B promoter region, which was inherited from Petunia axillaris, one of the parental species of Pe. hybrida. Phylogenetic and syntenic analyses of Cullin genes in various eudicots show that three Solanaceae-specific CUL1 genes share a common origin, with CUL1-P dedicated to S-RNase-related reproductive processes. However, CUL1-B is a dispersed duplicate of CUL1-P present only in Petunia, and not in the other species of the Solanaceae family examined.

For example, managed honey bees (Apis mellifera) have been widely introduced outside their native range and are increasingly dominant floral visitors. Multiple studies have documented how honey bees impact native bee communities through floral resource competition, but few have quantified how these competitive interactions indirectly affect pollination and plant reproduction. Such indirect effects are hard to detect because honey bees are themselves pollinators and may directly impact pollination through their own floral visits. The potentially huge but poorly understood impacts that non-native honey bees have on native plant populations combined with increased pressure from beekeepers to place hives in U.S. National Parks and Forests makes exploring impacts of honey bee introductions on native plant pollination of pressing concern. In this study, we used experimental hive additions, field observations, as well as single-visit and multiple-visit pollination effectiveness trials across multiple years to untangle the direct and indirect impacts of increasing honey bee abundance on the pollination of an ecologically important wildflower, Camassia quamash. We found compelling evidence that honey bee introductions indirectly decrease pollination by reducing nectar and pollen availability and competitively excluding visits from more effective native bees. In contrast, the direct impact of honey bee visits on pollination was negligible, and, if anything, negative. Honey bees were ineffective pollinators, and increasing visit quantity could not compensate for inferior visit quality. Indeed, although the effect was not statistically significant, increased honey bee visits had a marginally negative impact on seed production. Thus, honey bee introductions may erode longstanding plant-pollinator mutualisms, with negative consequences for plant reproduction. Our study calls for a more thorough understanding of the indirect effects of species introductions and more careful coordination of hive placements.",10.1002/ecy.3939,36457280,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:11:07.470705-04:00,No,,

Biological sciences,Proc Biol Sci,01,12,2022,"In animal-pollinated angiosperms, the 'male-function' hypothesis claims that male reproductive success (RS) should benefit from large floral displays, through pollinator attraction, while female RS is expected to be mainly limited by resource availability. As appealing as this theory might be, studies comparing selection strength on flower number in both sexes rarely document the expected asymmetry. This discrepancy could arise because flower number impacts both pollinator attraction and overall gamete number. In this study, we artificially manipulate floral displays to disentangle the fertility versus pollinator attraction components of selection, both in terms of mating and RS. In females, flower number was under strong fertility selection, as predicted in the absence of pollen limitation. By contrast, in males, flower number was mainly under sexual selection, which in turn increased male RS. However, these selection patterns were not different in males with artificially increased floral displays. This suggests that sexual selection acting on flower number in males does not occur because flower number increases pollinator attraction, but rather because more pollen is available to disperse on more mates. Our study illustrates the power of disentangling various components of selection with potentially sex-specific effects for understanding the evolution of sexual dimorphism.",10.1098/rspb.2022.1987,36448279,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 17:41:03.793063-04:00,No,,

Birch pollen is the major allergenic tree pollen in parts of Europe. ITULAZAX&#xae; is a sublingual immunotherapy tablet for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe AR and/or conjunctivitis induced by pollen from the birch homologous group. The aim was to compare the costs of treating AR with ITULAZAX&#xae; versus subcutaneous ALUTARD SQ&#xae; Betula verrucosa (ALUTARD SQ&#xae;) from a Danish societal perspective. A cost-minimization model was developed to capture costs of allergy immunotherapy (AIT), interactions with healthcare professionals (HCPs) in three different care settings (general practice, allergy specialist, and hospital), and indirect costs arising from absenteeism and presenteeism. The cost-minimization analysis was conducted over a 3-year time horizon with costs reported in 2021 Danish Kroner (DKK) and Euros (EUR) based on the European Central Bank 365-day average exchange rate. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed. The base case analysis showed that the total cost of treatment over 3&#xa0;years was estimated to be DKK 49,117 (EUR 6598) per patient with ALUTARD SQ&#xae;, compared with DKK 30,996 (EUR 4164) with ITULAZAX&#xae;, reflecting a cost saving of DKK 18,121 (EUR 2434) per patient with ITULAZAX&#xae; over 3&#xa0;years.

Thorough understanding of the ecological consequences of honeybee farming on these complex plant-pollinator-microbe interactions is a prerequisite for sustainable honeybee keeping. Most research on plant-pollinator-microbe interactions have focused on temperate agricultural systems. Therefore, information on a wild plant that is a seasonal bottleneck for pollinators in cold climate such as Salix phylicifolia is of specific importance. We investigated how floral visitation by insects influences the community structure of bacteria and fungi in Salix phylicifolia inflorescences under natural conditions. Insect visitors were experimentally excluded with net bags. We analyzed the microbiome and measured pollen removal in open and bagged inflorescences in sites where honeybees were foraging and in sites without honeybees. Site and plant individual explained most of the variation in floral microbial communities. Insect visitation and honeybees had a smaller but significant effect on the community composition of microbes. Honeybees had a specific effect on the inflorescence microbiome and, e.g., increased the relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the bacterial order Lactobacillales. Site had a significant effect on the amount of pollen removed from inflorescences but this was not due to honeybees. Insect visitors increased bacterial and especially fungal OTU richness in the inflorescences. Pollinator visits explained 38% variation in fungal richness, but only 10% in bacterial richness.

Recent studies have pointed out that pollen grains produced by male plants of <i>T. baccata</i> and <i>J. communis</i> subjected to a long period of fertilizer supplementation have lower in vitro germination ability and higher nitrogen content. To gain molecular insights into these observations, we conducted GC-MS analysis of both species to characterize the metabolomes of dry, mature pollen grains, which allowed for the identification and quantification of more than 200 metabolites. The results demonstrated that fertilizer supplementation impacts the relative content of 14 metabolites in <i>J. communis</i> (9 downregulated and 5 upregulated) and 21 in <i>T. baccata</i> (6 downregulated and 15 upregulated). Although plants showed little similarity in patterns, in metabolite profiles, both up and down fold-changes were observed. This is the first report on the gymnosperm pollen grain metabolomic profile and changes induced by long-term nitrogen and phosphorus supplementation.

Tomato breeding and productivity highly depend on the use of hybrid seeds and their higher yield, environmental adaption, and disease tolerance. However, the emasculation procedure during hybridization raises tomato seed production costs and labor expenses. Using male sterility is an effective way to reduce the cost of hybrid seeds and ensure cultivar purity. Recent developments in CRISPR genome editing technology enabled tomato breeders to investigate the male sterility genes and to develop male-sterile tomato lines. In the current study, the tomato Acotinase (<i>SlACO</i>) gene family was investigated via in silico tools and functionally characterized with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption. Genome-wide blast and HMM search represented two <i>SlACO</i> genes located on different tomato chromosomes. Both genes were estimated to have a segmental duplication in the tomato genome due to their identical motif and domain structure. One of these genes, <i>SlACO2</i>, showed a high expression profile in all generative cells of tomato. Therefore, the <i>SlACO2</i> gene was targeted with two different gRNA/Cas9 constructs to identify their functional role in tomatoes. The gene was mutated in a total of six genome-edited tomato lines, two of which were homozygous. Surprisingly, pollen viability was found to be extremely low in mutant plants compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Likewise, the number of seeds per fruit also sharply decreased more than fivefold in mutant lines (10-12 seeds) compared to that in WT (67 seeds). The pollen shape, anther structures, and flower colors/shapes were not significantly varied between the mutant and WT tomatoes. The mutated lines were also subjected to salt and mannitol-mediated drought stress to test the effect of <i>SlACO2</i> on abiotic stress tolerance. The results of the study indicated that mutant tomatoes have higher tolerance with significantly lower MDA content under stress conditions.

One current theory predicts that herbivores enhance plant biodiversity at high productivity but have the opposite effect at low productivity. Yet, empirical support for the importance of site productivity as a mediator of these herbivore impacts is equivocal. Here, we synthesize data from 252 large-herbivore exclusion studies, spanning a 20-fold range in site productivity, to test an alternative hypothesis-that herbivore-induced changes in the competitive environment determine the response of plant biodiversity to herbivory irrespective of productivity. Under this hypothesis, when herbivores reduce the abundance (biomass, cover) of dominant species (for example, because the dominant plant is palatable), additional resources become available to support new species, thereby increasing biodiversity. By contrast, if herbivores promote high dominance by increasing the abundance of herbivory-resistant, unpalatable species, then resource availability for other species decreases reducing biodiversity. We show that herbivore-induced change in dominance, independent of site productivity or precipitation (a proxy for productivity), is the best predictor of herbivore effects on biodiversity in grassland and savannah sites. Given that most herbaceous ecosystems are dominated by one or a few species, altering the competitive environment via herbivores or by other means may be an effective strategy for conserving biodiversity in grasslands and savannahs globally.",10.1038/s41559-018-0696-y,30374174,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 17:54:14.181436-04:00,No,,

We address this gap in natural populations of the self-incompatible native dandelion, Taraxacum ceratophorum, where selfing only occurs in association with hybridization from exotic Taraxacum officinale. We tested whether self-fertilization rate increases in the hybrid zone, as predicted due to the mentor effect. Using results from these investigations, we created an exponential growth model to estimate the potential demographic impacts of the mentor effect on T. ceratophorum population growth. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the mentor effect in Taraxacum depends on the prevalence of pollinator-mediated outcross pollen deposition rather than self-pollination. Demographic models suggest that reduced outcrossing in T. ceratophorum under exotic invasion could negatively impact population growth through inbreeding depression.

We compare the response of three bee species (Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis) under laboratory conditions. Survival, physiology, and sensitivity, after exposure to the fungicide prochloraz, the insecticide chlorantraniliprole, and their mixture with different nutritional resources (sugar only, sugar with amino acids or pollen) were observed. Prochloraz reduced the bee survival of A. mellifera and O. bicornis fed with pollen, but not with other diets. Chlorantraniliprole impaired the survival of A. mellifera fed with sugar or pollen diet, but not with amino acid diet. The mixture impaired survival of A. mellifera and O. bicornis in association with every diet. B. terrestris was only affected by chlorantraniliprole and its mixture with prochloraz fed with sugar diet. The activity of P450 reductase was higher in A. mellifera fed with amino acids in all treatments, whereas no effect emerged in O. bicornis and B. terrestris.

Pollen grains and fungal spores belong to some of the most crucial aeroallergens. Other allergenic bioparticles in the atmospheric microbiome can include microalgae, fern spores and mites. In this study, we evaluated if and to what extent air pollutants and weather parameters drive the daily variation in airborne concentrations of broad spectrum of bioparticles (pollen grains, fungal spores, microalgae, fern spores and invertebrates) in the air of Bratislava over 3&#xa0;years, 2019-2021. Air samples were collected using a Hirst-type volumetric sampler. Based on the results of Spearman's correlation analysis, air temperature seems to be the most influential meteorological factor, positively associated with the concentration of all types of bioparticles at assemblage level, even though the association with microalgae was negative. Wind speed, known to have a diluting effect on most airborne particles, appears to be the most influential for microalgae, as their concentration in the air increases along with rising wind speed. Considering air pollutants, correlation analysis revealed that as the daily concentrations of ozone, PM<sub>10</sub>, CO and/or NO<sub>2</sub> increased, so did the levels of most types of analysed bioaerosols at the assemblage level. Regarding that bioparticles may act as carriers for inorganic particles and amplify their allergenic impact, a concomitant increment in the airborne concentration of both organic and inorganic pollutants poses a threat to allergy sufferers in the study area. The concentration of microalgae, on the other hand, decreases with rising levels of CO, NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>; thereby, their synergistic effect on allergy sufferers is negligible.

Therefore, a better understanding of the dragon fruit SI mechanism is needed to improve breeding efficiency and ultimate production costs. To reveal the underlying mechanisms of SI in dragon fruit, plant anatomy, <i>de novo</i> RNA sequencing-based transcriptomic analysis, and multiple bioinformatic approaches were used to analyze gene expression in the pistils of the self-pollinated and cross-pollinated dragon fruit flowers at different intervals of time after pollination. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that the pollen of 'Hongshuijing', a self-incompatible dragon fruit variety (<i>S. monacanthus</i>), germinated on its own stigma. However, the pollen tube elongation has ceased at 1/2 of the style, confirming that dragon fruit experiences gametophyte self-incompatibility (GSI). We found that the pollen tube elongation <i>in vitro</i> was inhibited by self-style glycoproteins in the SI variety, indicating that glycoproteins were involved in SI. That is to say the female S factor should be homologous of S-RNase or PrsS (<i>P. rhoeas</i> stigma S factor), both of which are glycoproteins and are the female S factors of the two known GSI mechanism respectively. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that among the 43,954 assembled unigenes from pistil, there were six S-RNase genes, while 158 F-box genes were identified from a pollen transcriptomic dataset. There were no P. <i>rhoeas</i> type S genes discovered. Thus, the identified S-RNase and F-box represent the candidate female and male S genes, respectively. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the self and cross-pollinated pistils at different time intervals led to the identification of 6,353 genes. We then used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to find some non-S locus genes in SI responses in dragon fruit. Additionally, 13 transcription factors (TFs) (<i>YABBY4, ANL2, ERF43, ARF2, BLH7, KNAT6, PIF3</i>, two <i>OBF1</i>, two <i>HY5</i> and two <i>LHY/CCA</i>) were identified to be involved in dragon fruit GSI. Thus, we uncovered candidate S and non-S genes and predicted more SI-related genes for a more detailed investigation of the molecular mechanism of dragon fruit SI. Our findings suggest that dragon fruit possesses a GSI system and involves some unique regulators.

The data set has ~18,000 interaction records forming 482 networks, each containing between one and 1061 interaction links. Each network was sampled for about 200&#x2009;h or less, with few exceptions. A total of 641 plant genera within 136 different families and 39 orders were reported, with the most abundant and rich families being Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Rubiaceae. Invertebrates interacting with these plants were all arthropods from 10 orders, 129 families, and 581 genera, comprising 2419 morphotypes (including 988 named species). Hymenoptera was the most abundant and diverse order, with at least six times more records than the second-ranked order (Lepidoptera). The complete data set shows Hymenoptera interacting with all plant orders and also shows Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera to be important nodes. Among plants, Asterales and Fabales had the highest number of interactions. The best sampled environment was forest (~8000 records), followed by pastures and crops. Savanna, grasslands, and urban environments (among others) were also reported, indicating a wide range of approaches dedicated to collecting flower-invertebrate interaction data in the Atlantic Forest domain. Nevertheless, most reported data were from forest understory or lower strata, indicating a knowledge gap about flower-invertebrate interactions at the canopy. Also, access to remote regions remains a limitation, generating sampling bias across the geographical range of the Atlantic Forest.

This study was carried out to further explore their roles in pollen tube growth. The results showed that seven members (CoFLA1/2/3/4/7/8/17) of the CoFLAs family were identified by sequence characteristics, and they all possessed the fasciclin 1 (FAS1) domain and H1 and H2 conserved domains. They were all located on the plasma membranes of tobacco epidermal cells, and the GPI-anchor sequences of CoFLA1/2/3/4 determined the membrane localization. In flower tissues, CoFLA2 and CoFLA8 were not expressed in the pollen tube but were expressed in the unpollinated style and ovary; the others were all expressed in the pollen tube. In the pollination-compatible style and ovary, they exhibited different expression patterns. Furthermore, all CoFLAs promoted pollen germination in vitro, while only CoFLA7 significantly promoted pollen tube elongation, and the expression of CoFLA1/3/4/7/17 in pollen tubes was regulated by CoFLA proteins. The ABA and ABA synthetic inhibitor (sodium tungstate, ST) both inhibited pollen tube elongation; however, only ST downregulated the expression of CoFLA1/7/17 and upregulated the expression of CoFLA4.

This study examines potential decoupling of flowering and leafing phenophases in Betulaceae species (i.e. Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula and Corylus avellana) over long-term (1951-2015) and as shorter (15-year) periods. Phenological phases for flowering and leaf unfolding of Betulaceae species from the Pan-European Phenology (PEP725) database were examined along with maximum and minimum daily temperature data for the periods September-October-November (SON), December-January-February (DJF) and March-April-May (MAM). Significant increases in temperature since 1951 have been recorded in the relevant chilling and forcing periods. Both flowering and leaf unfolding phenophases are advancing, but flowering is advancing faster than leaf unfolding. This is increasing the time between phenophases, although analysis of 15-year periods shows that the pattern of change was not constant. The results presented here represent the most comprehensive analysis of flowering and leaf unfolding phenophases of Betulaceae species using the PEP725 database to date.

The interaction between the tapetum and sporogenous cells in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) plants, despite its importance for breeding purposes, is poorly understood. To investigate this process, gene editing was used to generate loss-of-function mutants that showed the complete and specific absence of tapetal cells. These plants were obtained targeting the previously uncharacterized Solyc03g097530 (SlTPD1) gene, essential for tapetum specification in tomato plants. In the absence of tapetum, sporogenous cells developed and callose deposition was observed.

Known as the cradle of a series of representative Neolithic cultures, south Hangzhou Bay (SHB) witnessed substantial changes in both landscape and human subsistence during the Holocene, yet the relationship between them was not well established. Here, we combined archaeobotanical results from sediment cores with archaeological findings to illustrate the subsistence changes during the Neolithic regime in the context of the landscape process in SHB. Our result showed that SHB was inundated by marine transgression 8,200 years ago without significant human imprints. At 8,200-7,600 cal yr. BP, the initial coastal wetland formation at locations with the semi-enclosed landscape would have facilitated the activities of hunting-gathering, incipient rice cultivation, and collecting seafood if accessible. Pollen and phytoliths evidence from multiple sediment cores in the Yaojiang Valley (YJV) suggested a desalinization process of wetland in the following hundreds of years. This amelioration of the environment had favored the intermittent rice cultivation at various locations in the YJV, where archaeological evidence was absent. Since 7,000-6,600 cal yr. BP, as freshwater wetland expanded with coastal progradation, a wide variety of food resources became available. Meanwhile, rice domestication began to serve as a crucial food supplement as evidenced by both microfossil results and archaeological findings. With the expansion of the coastal plain after 5,500 cal&#x2009;yr. BP, rice farming became widespread and rice consumption was increasingly important in the diet, as supported by discoveries of upgraded farming tools, abundant rice remains, and ancient rice paddies.

Generalist species and networks are expected to be more resilient, and therefore understanding the dynamics of specialization and generalization in ecological networks is a key focus in a time of rapid global change. Whilst diet generalization is frequently studied, our understanding of how it changes over time is limited. Here we explore temporal variation in diet specificity in the honeybee (Apis mellifera), using pollen DNA metabarcoding of honey samples, through the foraging season, over two years. We find that, overall, honeybees are generalists that visit a wide range of plants, but there is temporal variation in the degree of specialization. Temporal specialization of honeybee colonies corresponds to periods of resource limitation, identified as a lack of honey stores. Honeybees experience a lack of preferred resources in June when switching from flowering trees in spring to shrubs and herbs in summer. Investigating temporal patterns in specialization can identify periods of resource limitation that may lead to species and network vulnerability. Diet specificity must therefore be explored at different temporal scales in order to fully understand species and network stability in the face of ecological change.",10.1111/mec.16719,36200580,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 12:12:17.617259-04:00,No,,

Earlier studies suggested that shifts from such neutral or antagonistic relationships toward mutualistic pollination interactions between flowers and insects occurred repeatedly during angiosperm evolution. However, the evolutionary mechanisms and adaptations, which accompanied shifts toward effective pollination, are barely understood, and evidence for such scenarios has been lacking. Here, we show that Syngonium hastiferum (Araceae), a Neotropical representative of an otherwise beetle-pollinated clade, is pollinated by plant bugs (Miridae; Heteroptera), which are florivores of Syngonium schottianum and other Araceae species. We found that S.&#xa0;hastiferum differs in several floral traits from its beetle-pollinated relatives. Scent emission and thermogenesis occur in the morning instead of the evening hours, and its pollen surface is spiny instead of smooth. Furthermore, the floral scent of S.&#xa0;hastiferum includes a previously unknown natural product, (Z)-3-isopropylpent-3-en-1-ol, which we show to have a function in specifically attracting the plant bug pollinators. This is the first known case of a specialized plant bug pollination system and provides clear evidence for the hypothesis that the adoption of antagonistic florivores as pollinators can drive flower diversification.

Climate change affects the range of allergenic species as well as the timing and length of the pollen season. In Egypt, data on pollinosis are scarce. This study aimed to identify the most prevalent pollen causing allergies among Egyptian patients with respiratory allergies. A total of 200 patients with respiratory allergic diseases, allergic rhinitis and/or bronchial asthma (BA), were included. Medical history taking and physical examinations were conducted on each patient. Complete blood count (CBC), total immunoglobulin E (IgE) determination, spirometry, specific IgE, and skin prick tests (SPTs) for common aeroallergens and food were performed. Of the 200 patients, 106 (53%) were females. The age of study subjects ranged 16-66 years (mean &#xb1; SD, 34.42 &#xb1; 13.0), and 65% were living in urban areas. Grass pollen, mainly from Timothy grass and maize, were the most prevalent allergens (28.5%). Timothy grass was the most common type of pollen in patients with AR (28.3 %). Elder pollen was more prevalent among asthmatic patients (P = 0.004). Bermuda grass was statistically more prevalent in rural than in urban areas (P = 0.008). Maize was linked to uncontrolled BA, whereas Timothy grass was the most prevalent among patients with moderate/severe AR. Forty-three patients had oral allergy syndrome; oranges and tomatoes were the most cross-reactive food allergies (12% and 11.5%, respectively). Exacerbation of allergic symptoms was noted during January, December, March, and June. In conclusion, pollen plays a substantial role in affecting patients with respiratory allergies in Egypt.

Palynological analysis of a total of 45 river water samples collected from the middle reaches of the Yellow River and its major tributaries, identifies the distribution patterns, possible sources of pollen and relationship with the catchment vegetation. The results reveal that the pollen assemblages in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is dominated by herbaceous taxa, and the pollen is mainly derived from fluvial sources. Higher concentrations of the pollen tend to occur in the southern part of the study area. The Luo River is the main source of tree pollen in the Wei River Basin, while the Sanchuan River and Xinshui River are the main sources of tree pollen in the mainstream of the Yellow River. Herbaceous pollen mainly originates from the flood plain, and from channel bars and point bars, and there is no obvious relationship between herbaceous pollen and tributary inputs.

Identify and characterize a male-sterility gene ZmMs13 encoding an ABCG transporter in modulating anther and pollen development in maize. Phenotypic, cytological observations, and histochemistry staining were performed to characterize the ms13-6060 mutant. Map-based cloning and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing were used to identify ZmMs13 gene. RNA-seq data and qPCR analyses, phylogenetic and microsynteny analyses, transient dual-luciferase reporter and EMSA assays, subcellular localization, and ATPase activity and lipidomic analyses were carried out to determine the regulatory mechanisms of ZmMs13 gene. Maize ms13-6060 mutant displays complete male sterility with delayed callose degradation, premature tapetal programmed cell death (PCD), and defective pollen exine and anther cuticle formation. ZmMs13 encodes a plasm membrane (PM)- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized half-size ABCG transporter (ZmABCG2a). The allele of ZmMs13 in ms13-6060 mutant has one amino acid (I311) deletion due to a 3-bp deletion in its fourth exon. The I311 and other conserved amino acid K99 are essential for the ATPase and lipid binding activities of ZmMS13. ZmMs13 is specifically expressed in anthers with three peaks at stages S5, S8b, and S10, which are successively regulated by transcription factors ZmbHLH122, ZmMYB84, and ZmMYB33-1/-2 at these three stages. The triphasic regulation of ZmMs13 is sequentially required for callose dissolution, tapetal PCD and pollen exine development, and anther cuticle formation, corresponding to transcription alterations of callose-, ROS-, PCD-, sporopollenin-, and anther cuticle-related genes in ms13-6060 anthers. ms13-6060 mutation with one key amino acid (I311) deletion greatly reduces ZmMS13 ATPase and lipid binding activities and displays multiple effects during maize male reproduction.

These pollen-inspired PhC barcodes are imparted with extremely high specific surface area and excellent prickly surface nanostructures, which can improve the capture rate and detection sensitivity of exosomes. As the internal periodic structures are kept during the hydrothermal synthesis process, the pollen-inspired PhC barcodes exhibit obvious and stable structural colors for identification, which enables multiplex detection of exosomes. Thus, the pollen-inspired PhC barcodes can not only effectively capture and enrich cancer-related exosomes but also support multiplex screening of exosomes with high sensitivity.

In this study, conducted in Iowa, USA, we found that increases in both the abundance and diversity of floral resources in strips of native prairie vegetation within agricultural production fields greatly and positively influenced the bee community. The benefits to the bee community were important for both common and uncommon species and the effect may be strongest early in the season. Using networks of co-occurrence between plant and bee species, we were able to identify two native prairie plants, Ratibida pinnata and Zizia aurea, as potentially keystone resources that can be used to support native bees. When we evaluated the effect of reconstructed prairie strips on bees in the context of the surrounding landscape, we found that these conservation practices had positive effects on bees in agriculturally-dominated areas and that these effects were detectable in low to high complexity landscapes with 8-69% natural habitat. In landscapes dominated by crops with few pollen and nectar resources the inclusion of native prairie strips can buffer the decline of bees and effectively increase bee abundance and diversity.",10.1371/journal.pone.0240354,33120405,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:29:21.074764-04:00,No,,

However, we still have a poor understanding of how environmental factors and spatiotemporal variability shape these communities. Here, we investigate what drives structure and beta diversity in a plant-pollinator metacommunity from the Australian alpine region using two approaches: pollen DNA metabarcoding (MB) and observations. Individual pollinators often carry pollen from multiple plant species, and therefore we expected MB to reveal a more diverse and complex network structure. We used two gene regions (ITS2 and trnL) to identify plant species present in the pollen loads of 154 insect pollinator specimens from three alpine habitats and construct MB networks, and compared them to networks based on observations alone. We compared species and interaction turnover across space for both types of networks, and evaluated their differences for plant phylogenetic diversity and beta diversity. We found significant structural differences between the two types of networks; notably, MB networks were much less specialized but more diverse than observation networks, with MB detecting many cryptic plant species. Both approaches revealed that alpine pollination networks are very generalized, but we estimated a high spatial turnover of plant species (0.79) and interaction rewiring (0.6) as well as high plant phylogenetic diversity (0.68) driven by habitat differences based on the larger diversity of plant species and species interactions detected with MB. Overall, our findings show that habitat and microclimatic heterogeneity drives diversity and fine-scale spatial turnover of alpine plant-pollinator networks.",10.1111/mec.16682,36065738,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 15:10:07.149065-04:00,No,,

In recent years, the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has become routine, allowing us to understand the population structure, find divergent lines for crosses, and illuminate the origin of crops. However, the focus on SNPs overlooks other forms of variation, such as copy number variation (CNVs). Lentil is the third most important cold-season legume and was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent. We genotyped 324 accessions that represent its global diversity, and using both SNPs and CNVs, we dissected the population structure and genetic variation, and identified candidate genes. Eight clusters were detected, most of them located in or near the Fertile Crescent, even though different clusters were present in distinct regions. The cluster from South Asia was particularly differentiated and presented low diversity, contrasting with the clusters from the Mediterranean and the northern temperate. Accessions from North America were mainly assigned to one cluster and were highly diverse, reflecting the efforts of breeding programs to integrate variation. Thirty-three genes were identified as candidates under selection and among their functions were sporopollenin synthesis in pollen, a component of chlorophyll B reductase that partially determines the antenna size, and two genes related to the import system of chloroplasts. Eleven percent of all lentil genes and 21% of lentil disease resistance genes were affected by CNVs. The gene categories overrepresented in these genes were """"enzymes,"""" """"Cell Wall Organization,"""" and """"external stimuli response."""" All the genes found in the latter were associated with pathogen response. CNVs provided information about population structure and might have played a role in adaptation.

Molecular basis of disease,Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,18,10,2022,"Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases. In many cases it is preceded by the development of an immune response to allergens such as animal fur, dust, pollens and etc. In human population this disease is heterogeneous, and no selective drugs are available at the moment for some endotypes of asthma. The role of the adaptive immune system in the pathogenesis of asthma was extensively studied, while the role of innate immune cells, in particular myeloid cells, was not sufficiently addressed. Myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, are characterized by high plasticity, heterogenicity and ability to undergo polarization in response to various pathogenic stimuli, including those engaging innate immune receptors. Recently, special attention was drawn to the link between polarization of macrophages and cell metabolism. We hypothesized that immunometabolic reprogramming of myeloid cells, in particular, of macrophages and dendritic cells during sensitization with an allergen may affect further immune response and asthma development. To test this hypothesis, we generated distinct types of myeloid cells in vitro from murine bone marrow and analyzed their immunometabolic profiles upon activation with house dust mite extract (HDM) and its key active components. We found that the combination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and beta-glucan is sufficient to upregulate proinflammatory cytokine production as well as respiratory and glycolytic capacity of myeloid cells, comparably to HDM. This specific immunometabolic phenotype was associated with altered mitochondrial morphology and possibly with increased ROS production in macrophages. Moreover, we found that both TNF production and metabolic remodeling of macrophages in response to HDM are TLR4-dependent processes. Altogether, these results expand our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying asthma induction and pathogenesis and may potentially lead to new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this disease.",10.1016/j.bbadis.2022.166531,36038040,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:11:49.574407-04:00,No,,

The negative effects of nectar robbing on plant reproductive success have been widely reported, but the reasons for possible positive effects demand further investigation. The goal of the study was to evaluate the effects of nectar robbing on the reproductive success of <i>Delphinium caeruleum</i>. Two staminodes cover the stamens and pistils in the flowers of <i>D. caeruleum</i>, forming a """"double door"""" type of structure that compels pollinators to physically manipulate the staminodes to access the sex organs. In order to explore whether the operative strength required to open the staminodes is affected by actions associated with nectar robbing, we set up five different treatment groups: no nectar robbing, natural nectar robbing, artificial nectar robbing, hole making, and nectar removal. A biological tension sensor was used to measure the operative strength required to open the staminodes in the flowers. We also assessed the effect of nectar robbing on the flower-visiting behavior of pollinators and the effect of nectar robbing on reproductive fitness by the flower. The results showed that the operative strength needed to open staminodes was reduced by nectar robbers but not by artificial nectar robbing, hole making, or nectar removal. The flowers' continuous visitation rate and visitation frequency by pollinators decreased significantly in robbed flowers. Both the pollen export and pollen deposition in naturally robbed flowers were significantly higher than those in nonrobbed flowers. Our results demonstrate that nectar robbers play an indirect positive role in the reproductive fitness of <i>D. caeruleum</i> flowers by reducing the operative strength of staminodes to promote pollen transfer.

These values are used to calculate a dissimilarity index between any pollen sample and every biome, and thus assign the sample to the most likely biome. We calculate a threshold value for each modern biome; fossil samples with scores below the threshold for all modern biomes are thus identified as non-analogue vegetation. We applied the new method to the EMBSeCBIO region to compare its performance with existing reconstructions. The method captured changes in the importance of individual taxa along environmental gradients. The balanced accuracy obtained for the EMBSeCBIO region using the new method was better than obtained using biomisation (77% vs. 65%).

Therefore, mutating the genes specifically functioning in meiosis may be an alternative way to achieve seedless watermelon. REC8, as a key component of the cohesin complex in meiosis, is dramatically essential for sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation. However, the role of REC8 in meiosis has not yet been characterized in watermelon. Here, we identified ClREC8 as a member of RAD21/REC8 family with a high expression in male and female flowers of watermelon. In situ hybridization analysis showed that ClREC8 was highly expressed at the early stage of meiosis during pollen formation. Knocking out ClREC8 in watermelon led to decline of pollen vitality. After pollinating with foreign normal pollen, the ovaries of ClREC8 knockout lines could inflate normally but failed to form seeds. We further compared the meiosis chromosomes of pollen mother cells in different stages between the knockout lines and the corresponding wild type. The results indicated that ClREC8 was required for the monopolar orientation of the sister kinetochores in Meiosis I. Additionally, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis between WT and the knockout lines revealed that the disruption of ClREC8 caused the expression levels of mitosis-related genes and meiosis-related genes to decrease. Our results demonstrated ClREC8 has a specific role in Meiosis I of watermelon germ cells, and loss-of-function of the ClREC8 led to seedless fruit, which may provide an alternative strategy to breed cultivars with seedless watermelon.",10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.111394,35905897,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:04:25.303844-04:00,No,,

There is no universal standard for objective quality assessment of bee pollen based on its chemical composition. Here, we report metabolomic analysis of 11 bee pollen samples from Spain, China, and Australia for quality control. The characteristics of the samples depend on the sucrose, nucleoside, amino acid, and flavanol concentrations. Bee pollen samples from Spain and Australia had higher sucrose and adenosine concentrations, whereas those from China had higher trigonelline, uridine, and cytidine concentrations.

Besides providing basic nutrition, they have great potential for boosting human health. The balanced consumption of vegetables is highly recommended for supplementing the human body with better nutrition density, dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and bioactive compounds. However, the production and quality of fresh vegetables are influenced directly or indirectly by exposure to high temperatures or heat stress (HS). A decline in quality traits and harvestable yield are the most common effects of HS among vegetable crops. Heat-induced morphological damage, such as poor vegetative growth, leaf tip burning, and rib discoloration in leafy vegetables and sunburn, decreased fruit size, fruit/pod abortion, and unfilled fruit/pods in beans, are common, often rendering vegetable cultivation unprofitable. Further studies to trace down the possible physiological and biochemical effects associated with crop failure reveal that the key factors include membrane damage, photosynthetic inhibition, oxidative stress, and damage to reproductive tissues, which may be the key factors governing heat-induced crop failure. The reproductive stage of plants has extensively been studied for HS-induced abnormalities. Plant reproduction is more sensitive to HS than the vegetative stages, and affects various reproductive processes like pollen germination, pollen load, pollen tube growth, stigma receptivity, ovule fertility and, seed filling, resulting in poorer yields. Hence, sound and robust adaptation and mitigation strategies are needed to overcome the adverse impacts of HS at the morphological, physiological, and biochemical levels to ensure the productivity and quality of vegetable crops. Physiological traits such as the stay-green trait, canopy temperature depression, cell membrane thermostability, chlorophyll fluorescence, relative water content, increased reproductive fertility, fruit numbers, and fruit size are important for developing better yielding heat-tolerant varieties/cultivars. Moreover, various molecular approaches such as omics, molecular breeding, and transgenics, have been proved to be useful in enhancing/incorporating tolerance and can be potential tools for developing heat-tolerant varieties/cultivars. Further, these approaches will provide insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms that govern thermotolerance and pave the way for engineering """"designer"""" vegetable crops for better health and nutritional security.

Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtSWEET13 and AtSWEET14, which are expressed in anthers and associated with seed yield, transport both sucrose and GA. However, it is still unclear which substrate transported by them directly affects anther development and seed yield. Histochemical staining, cross-sectioning and microscopy imaging techniques were used to investigate and interpret the phenotypes of the atsweet13;14 double mutant during anther development. Genetic complementation of atsweet13;14 using AtSWEET9, which transports sucrose but not GA, and the GA transporter AtNPF3.1, respectively, was conducted to test the substrate preference relevant to the biological process. The loss of both AtSWEET13 and AtSWEET14 resulted in reduced pollen viability and therefore decreased pollen germination. AtSWEET9 fully rescued the defects in pollen viability and germination of atsweet13;14, whereas AtNPF3.1 failed to do so, indicating that AtSWEET13/14-mediated sucrose rather than GA is essential for pollen fertility. AtSWEET13 and AtSWEET14 function mainly at the anther wall during late anther development stages, and they probably are responsible for sucrose efflux into locules to support pollen development to maturation, which is vital for subsequent pollen viability and germination.",10.1111/nph.18368,35811428,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:28:31.605516-04:00,No,,

The campaign started on March 1, 2021 in Siauliai (12 March in Helsinki) and continued till mid-May in Siauliai (end of May in Helsinki), thus recording the transition of the atmospheric biogenic aerosols profile from winter to summer. The observations included a variety of samplers working on different principles. The core of the program was based on 2- and 2.4--hourly sampling in Helsinki and Siauliai, respectively, with sticky slides (Hirst 24-h trap in Helsinki, Rapid-E slides in Siauliai). The slides were subsequently processed extracting the DNA from the collected aerosols, which was further sequenced using the 3-rd generation sequencing technology. The core sampling was accompanied with daily and daytime sampling using standard filter collectors. The hourly aerosol concentrations at the Helsinki monitoring site were obtained with a Poleno flow cytometer, which could recognize some of the aerosol types. The sampling campaign was supported by numerical modelling. For every sample, SILAM model was applied to calculate its footprint and to predict anthropogenic and natural aerosol concentrations, at both observation sites. The first results confirmed the feasibility of the DNA collection by the applied techniques: all but one delivered sufficient amount of DNA for the following analysis, in over 40% of the cases sufficient for direct DNA sequencing without the PCR step. A substantial variability of the DNA yield has been noticed, generally not following the diurnal variations of the total-aerosol concentrations, which themselves showed variability not related to daytime. An expected upward trend of the biological material amount towards summer was observed but the day-to-day variability was large. The campaign DNA analysis produced the first high-resolution dataset of bioaerosol composition in the North-European spring.

Forest regeneration can mitigate the negative effects of old-growth forest loss on species diversity, but less is known about the extent to which forest loss reduces genetic diversity in remnant populations and whether secondary forests play a role in the maintenance of genetic diversity. We quantified genetic diversity in a tropical hummingbird-pollinated understorey herb, Heliconia tortuosa, across a landscape mosaic of primary and secondary forest regrowth. Using microsatellite genotypes from &gt;850 adult and juvenile plants within 33 forest patches and extensive bird surveys, we examined the effect of contemporary and historical landscape features including forest age (primary vs. secondary forest), stand isolation and pollinator assemblages on genetic diversity and levels of inbreeding in H. tortuosa. We found that inbreeding was up to three times higher in secondary forest, and this effect was amplified with reductions in primary forest in the surrounding landscape through reduced observed heterozygosity in isolated fragments. Inbreeding in forest patches was negatively correlated with the local frequency of specialist long-distance foraging traplining hummingbirds. Traplining hummingbirds therefore appear to facilitate mating among unrelated plants-an inference we tested using empirically parameterized simulations. Higher levels of inbreeding in H. tortuosa are therefore associated with reduced functional diversity of hummingbirds in secondary forests and forest patches isolated from primary forests. Our findings suggest a cryptic consequence of primary forest loss and secondary forest regeneration through the disruption of mutualistic interactions resulting in the erosion of genetic diversity in a common understorey plant.",10.1111/mec.16607,35808851,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:30:11.190930-04:00,No,,

The patient's serum exhibited a strong positive reaction to strawberry GRP but not to peach GRP or peach LTP. The patient's basophils reacted to strawberry and peach GRP but not to peach LTP. Strawberry GRP may be a causative component for strawberry with exercise-induced generalized symptoms in this patient. This is the first study to investigate the role of GRP in strawberry with cofactor-induced allergic symptoms. Further epidemiological and clinical researches are necessary to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for patients with strawberry allergy.",10.1186/s13223-022-00692-0,35690877,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:06:58.866752-04:00,No,,

Pollen-stigma adhesion, which is the first step in male-female interaction during fertilization, requires proper pollen wall patterning. Callose, which is a &#x3b2;-1.3-glucan, is an essential polysaccharide that is required for pollen development and pollen wall formation. Mutations in <i>CALLOSE SYNTHASE 5</i> (<i>CalS5</i>) disrupt male meiotic callose accumulation; however, how CalS5 activity and callose synthesis are regulated is not fully understood. In this paper, we report the isolation of a <i>kompeito-1</i> (<i>kom-1</i>) mutant defective in pollen wall patterning and pollen-stigma adhesion in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Callose was not accumulated in <i>kom-1</i> meiocytes or microspores, which was very similar to the <i>cals5</i> mutant.

Pollen-mediated viruses cause serious economic losses in the fruit industry. Despite the commercial importance of pollen-associated viruses, the diversity of such viruses is yet to be fully explored. In this study, we performed metatranscriptomic analyses using RNA sequencing to investigate the viral diversity in imported apple and kiwifruit pollen. We identified 665 virus-associated contigs, which corresponded to four different virus species. We identified one virus, the apple stem grooving virus, from pear pollen and three viruses, including citrus leaf blotch virus, cucumber mosaic virus, and lychnis mottle virus in kiwifruit pollen.

Selfing species tend to share similar reproductive traits in morphology and function, and such a set of traits is called the 'selfing syndrome'. Although the genetic basis of the selfing syndrome has been of great interest to evolutionary biologists, knowledge of the causative genes or mutations was limited until recently. Thanks to advances in population genomic methodologies combined with high-throughput sequencing technologies, several studies have successfully unravelled the molecular and genetic basis for evolution of the selfing syndrome in <i>Capsella</i>, <i>Arabidopsis</i>, <i>Solanum</i> and other genera. Here we first introduce recent research examples that have explored the loci, genes and mutations responsible for the selfing syndrome traits, such as reductions in petal size or in pollen production, that are mainly relevant to pre-pollination processes. Second, we review the relationship between the evolution of selfing and interspecific pollen transfer, highlighting the findings of post-pollination reproductive barriers at the molecular level. We then discuss the emerging view of patterns in evolution of the selfing syndrome, such as the pervasive involvement of loss-of-function mutations and the relative importance of selection versus neutral degradation.

In this study, we aimed to characterize the prevalence of the molecular components of the common weed pollen allergens, birch pollen, walnut, and cross-reactive carbohydrate determinant (CCD), as well as investigate the relationship between the allergens and CCD in Chinese pollen-sensitized patients with allergic diseases. Based on previous vegetation surveys, serum samples from 165 pollen-sensitized patients with allergic diseases in Guangdong Province in southern China were used to test 19 crude allergen extracts, their components, and CCD using component-resolved diagnosis (CRD). Moreover, the potential associations among CCD, allergens, and their components were described. In the 165 samples, the most common sensitized allergens were goosefoot (43.0%), ragweed (40.6%), walnut (37.6%), walnut tree (37.6%), and mugwort (37.0%), followed by platane (35.2%), cocklebur (27.9%), and birch (24.2%). The positivity rate of CCD was 39.4%. Among the samples positive for mugwort, 11 (18.0%), 15 (24.6%), and 15 (24.6%) were positive for Art v 1, Art v 2, and Art v 3, respectively. Among the 67 patients sensitized to ragweed, only five (7.5%) were positive for Amb a 1. In the 40 patients sensitized to birch, Bet v 2 had the highest positivity rate (40.0%). There were 62 patients who were sensitized to walnut. Their components had a lower positivity rate (less than 15%). The hierarchical clustering and optimal scale analysis showed that Art v 4 and Bet v 2 were closely related, and 91.9% of CCD-positive samples were polysensitized. Meanwhile, Spearman's rank correlation method showed that CCD was closely correlated with the sensitization of crude allergen extracts, and there was a low correlation between CCD and allergen components.

In this paper, we confirm the presence of 2n eggs in the first alfalfa parents that produced hybrids. The test for 2n eggs involved pollinating 4x alfalfa with pollen from 8x alfalfa. The production of 8x progeny in the cross proved that selected alfalfa parents produced 2n eggs. Thus, 2n eggs appear to explain how the partial hybrids (hereafter hybrids) contain mostly alfalfa DNA and traits. However, two of the six alfalfa plants that did not hybridize with <i>M. arborea</i> also had 2n eggs.

After withdrawal from a flower, the pollinarium undergoes a bending movement such that the pollen masses become correctly orientated to strike the stigma. We evaluated the duration of pollinator visits to inflorescences and the effects of temperature on pollinaria reconfiguration in eight orchid species in order to analyze the effects of increasing air temperature on the changes in bending time, and thus on geitonogamy levels. The impact of temperature on insect behavior was not assessed because our priority was to understand the effects of temperature on the process of pollinaria reconfiguration. All the examined species showed natural reconfiguration times that were 1.7-3.0 times longer than the pollinator residency times. A higher temperature showed a reduction in bending time regardless of the species tested. However, the bending time was never shorter than the residence time of the insects on the flower.

1603,Mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 is obligatory for late pollen and early fruit development in tomato.,,,,,,Horticulture research,Hortic Res,16,07,2022,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are universal signal transduction modules regulating vegetative and reproductive development of plants. However, the molecular mechanisms of the <i>SlMPK4</i> gene in tomato pollen and fruit development remain elusive. <i>SlMPK4</i> is preferentially and highly expressed in tomato stamens and its mRNA levels increase during early flower development, peaking at the mature pollen stage. Either up- or downregulation of <i>SlMPK4</i> expression had no significant effect on tomato vegetative growth. However, RNAi-mediated suppression of <i>SlMPK4</i> caused defects in pollen development, resulting in pollen abortion. The aborted pollen grains were either malformed or collapsed and completely lacked viability, resulting in a predominantly reduced fruit set rate in RNAi lines compared with control and overexpressing transgenic plants. Interestingly, seed development was inhibited in RNAi lines. Moreover, &gt;12% of emasculated RNAi flowers developed seedless fruits without pollination. Anthers can produce typical microspore mother cells as well as uninucleate microspores, according to cytological investigations, while binucleate pollen ceased to produce typical mature pollen. Pollen abortion was further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy analysis at the binucleate stage in RNAi plants. The exine layer in aberrant pollen had a normal structure, while the intine layer appeared thicker. Suppression of <i>SlMPK4</i> affects the transcript level of genes related to cell wall formation and modification, cell signal transduction, and metabolic and biosynthetic processes. A subset of genes that may be putative substrates of plant MAPKs were also differentially changed in RNAi transgenic flowers.

Very few studies have assessed HP effects on stigma behavior. We conducted hand-pollination experiments with 10 HP donors to estimate HP effects on stigma behavior and stigmatic pollen germination in Campsis radicans (Bignoniaceae) at low and high pollen loads. We assessed the role of phylogenetic distance between donor and recipient, pollen size, and pollen aperture number in mediating HP effects. Additionally, we observed pollen tube growth to determine the conspecific pollen-tube-growth advantage. Stigma behavior differed significantly with HP of different species. Pollen load increased, while pollen size decreased, the percentage of permanent closure and stigmatic germination of HP. Stigmatic HP germination increased with increasing aperture number. However, HP effects did not depend on phylogenetic distance. In addition, conspecific pollen had a pollen-tube-growth advantage over HP.

Many mechanisms underlying spore liberation are explosive and have evolved independently multiple times. These mechanisms involve physiological processes such as water gain and loss, coupled with structural features using different plant tissues. Here we review how high-speed video and analyses of ultrastructure have defined new biomechanical mechanisms for the dispersal of gametophytes through the dissemination of haploid diaspores, including spores, pollen, and asexual reproductive propagules. This comparative review highlights the diversity and importance of rapid movements in plants for dispersing gametophytes and considerations for using combinations of high-speed video methods and microscopic techniques to understand these dispersal movements.

In temperate regions, most fruit trees need exposure to a certain period of low temperatures to overcome endodormancy. After endodormancy release, exposure to warm temperatures is needed to flower (ecodormancy). Chilling and heat requirements are genetically determined and, therefore, are specific for each species and cultivar. The lack of sufficient winter chilling can cause failures in flowering and fruiting, thereby compromising yield. Thus, the knowledge of the chilling and heat requirements is essential to optimize cultivar selection for different edaphoclimatic conditions. However, the lack of phenological or biological markers linked to the dormant and forcing periods makes it difficult to establish the end of endodormancy. This has led to indirect estimates that are usually not valid in different agroclimatic conditions. The increasing number of milder winters caused by climatic change and the continuous release of new cultivars emphasize the necessity of a proper biological marker linked to the endo- to ecodormancy transition for an accurate estimation of the agroclimatic requirements (AR) of each cultivar. In this work, male meiosis is evaluated as a biomarker to determine endodormancy release and to estimate both chilling and heat requirements in apricot. For this purpose, pollen development was characterized histochemically in 20 cultivars over 8 years, and the developmental stages were related to dormancy. Results were compared to three approaches that indirectly estimate the breaking of dormancy: an experimental methodology by evaluating bud growth in shoots collected periodically throughout the winter months and transferred to forcing chambers over 3 years, and two statistical approaches that relate seasonal temperatures and blooming dates in a series of 11-20 years by correlation and partial least square regression. The results disclose that male meiosis is a possible biomarker to determine the end of endodormancy and estimate AR in apricot.",10.3389/fpls.2022.842333,35463418,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:08:10.148690-04:00,No,,

Allergenic pollen is produced by wind pollinating plants and released in relatively low to massive amounts. Current climate changes, in combination with increasing urbanization, are likely to affect the presence of airborne allergenic pollen with respect to exposure intensity, timing as well as duration. Detailed analysis of long-term temporal trends at supranational scale may provide more comprehensive insight into these phenomena. To this end, the Spearman correlation was used to statistically compare the temporal trends in airborne pollen concentration monitored at the aerobiological stations which gathered the longest time-series (30-44 years) in the Benelux with a focus on the allergenic pollen taxa: <i>Alnus, Corylus, Betula, Fraxinus, Quercus, Platanus</i>, Poaceae, and <i>Artemisia</i>. Most arboreal species showed an overall trend toward an increase in the annual pollen integral and peak values and an overall trend toward an earlier start and end of the pollen season, which for <i>Betula</i> resulted in a significant decrease in season length. For the herbaceous species (Poaceae and <i>Artemisia</i>), the annual pollen integral and peak values showed a decreasing trend. The season timing of Poaceae showed a trend toward earlier starts and longer seasons in all locations. In all, these results show that temporal variations in pollen levels almost always follow a common trend in the Benelux, suggesting a similar force of climate change-driven factors, especially for <i>Betula</i> where a clear positive correlation was found between changes in temperature and pollen release over time. However, some trends were more local-specific indicating the influence of other environmental factors, e.g., the increasing urbanization in the surroundings of these monitoring locations. The dynamics in the observed trends can impact allergic patients by increasing the severity of symptoms, upsetting the habit of timing of the season, complicating diagnosis due to overlapping pollen seasons and the emergence of new symptoms due allergens that were weak at first.",10.3389/falgy.2021.676176,35387026,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:07:03.992794-04:00,No,,

Potential drivers of pollen change were examined including weather and satellite-derived vegetation indicators. The magnitude of the seasonal pollen index for grass showed almost a three-fold increase for 2016-2020 over 1994-1999.

This increase in turn, has been related, in part, to concurrent increases in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and temperature on pollen production and allergic disease generated from plant-based sources of pollen. Such links to anthropogenic climate change has suggested three significant and interrelated consequences associated with respiratory allergies or disease. First, warmer temperatures and a longer frost-free growing season can influence pollen season length and temporal exposure to airborne aeroallergens. Second, both warmer temperatures and additional CO<sub>2</sub> can increase the amount of pollen, the seasonal intensity, from spring through fall. Thirdly, there is evidence from oak and ragweed that rising levels of CO<sub>2</sub> could increase the allergen concentration of the pollen and symptom severity. However, while these outcomes are of obvious consequence, they do not fully encompass all of the plant derived changes that could, directly or indirectly, influence aeroallergen production, exposure, and consequences for public health.

Murine and human DC activation induced by either BPE or nLPS was inhibited by the TLR4 antagonist or by PMB, and abrogated in TLR4-deficient BMDCs compared to wild-type BMDCs. The lipid-free but not the protein-free fraction showed a reduced capacity to activate the TLR4 signaling and murine DCs. In human DCs, nLPS only partially reproduced the BPE-induced activation intensity. BPE-primed BMDCs efficiently stimulated T cell activation, which was repressed by the TLR4 antagonist or PMB, and the addition of nLPS to Bet v 1 did not reproduce the effect of BPE. <i>In vivo</i>, immunization with BPE induced a significant Th2 polarization, whereas administration of BPE pre-incubated with PMB showed a decreased tendency. These findings suggest that TLR4 is a major pathway by which BPE triggers DC activation that is involved in the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Further characterization of these BP-derived TLR4 adjuvants could provide new candidates for therapeutic strategies targeting specific mechanisms in BP-induced allergic inflammation.",10.3389/falgy.2021.680937,35386993,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:27:40.390337-04:00,No,,

In the skin multiple subsets of DCs with distinct roles reside at different depths. In this study antigen (=allergen for allergy) formulations were injected in <i>ex vivo</i> human skin in a depth-controlled manner by using a hollow microneedle injection system. Biopsies were harvested at the injection site, which were then cultured for 72 h. Subsequently, the crawled-out cells were collected from the medium and analyzed with flow cytometry. Intradermal administration of ovalbumin (OVA, model antigen) solution at various depths in the skin did not affect the migration and maturation of DCs. OVA was taken up efficiently by the DCs, and this was not affected by the injection depth. In contrast, Bet v 1, the major allergen in birch pollen allergy, was barely taken up by dermal DCs (dDCs). Antigens were more efficiently taken up by CD14<sup>+</sup> dDCs than CD1a<sup>+</sup> dDCs, which in turn were more efficient at taken up antigen than Langerhans cells. Subsequently, both OVA and Bet v 1 were formulated in cationic and anionic liposomes, which altered antigen uptake drastically following intradermal microinjection. While OVA uptake was reduced by formulation in liposomes, Bet v 1 uptake in dDCs was increased by encapsulation in both cationic and anionic liposomes. This highlights the potential use of liposomes as adjuvant in intradermal allergy vaccine delivery.

Biological sciences,Proc Biol Sci,07,04,2022,"Modern agriculture is becoming increasingly pollinator-dependent. However, the global stock of domesticated honeybees is growing at a slower rate than its demand, while wild bees are declining worldwide. This uneven scenario of high pollinator demand and low pollinator availability can translate into increasing pollination limitation, reducing the yield of pollinator-dependent crops. However, overall assessments of crop pollination limitation and the factors determining its magnitude are missing. Based on 52 published studies including 30 crops, we conducted a meta-analysis comparing crop yield in pollen-supplemented versus open-pollinated flowers. We assessed the overall magnitude of pollination limitation and whether this magnitude was influenced by (i) the presence/absence of managed honeybees, (ii) crop compatibility system (i.e. self-compatible/self-incompatible) and (iii) the interaction between these two factors. Overall, pollen supplementation increased yield by approximately 34%, indicating sizable pollination limitation. Deployment of managed honeybees and self-compatibility were associated with lower pollination limitation. Particularly, active honeybee management decreased pollination limitation among self-compatible but apparently not among self-incompatible crops. These findings indicate that current pollination regimes are, in general, inadequate to maximize crop yield, even when including managed honeybees, and stress the need of transforming the pollination management paradigm of agricultural landscapes.",10.1098/rspb.2022.0086,35382601,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:09:17.671987-04:00,No,,

However, their effects on reproductive development in fruit crops, such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), remain unclear. Here, we found that SlMBP22 overexpression (SlMBP22-OE) resulted in considerable alterations in floral morphology and affected the expression levels of several floral homeotic genes. Further analysis by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays demonstrated that SlMBP22 forms dimers with class A protein MACROCALYX (MC) and SEPALLATA (SEP) floral homeotic proteins TM5 and TM29, respectively. In addition, pollen viability and cross-fertilization assays suggested that the defect in female reproductive development was responsible for the infertility phenotype observed in the strong overexpression transgenic plants. Transgenic fruits with mild overexpression exhibited reduced size as a result of reduced cell expansion, rather than impaired cell division.

Betula pollen seasons show no significant trends for onset, first high day or duration but increasing pollen production in the Midlands region of the UK is being driven by warmer temperatures in the previous June and July. Quercus pollen seasons are starting earlier, due to increasing temperature and sunshine totals in April, but are not becoming more severe. The seasons are lasting longer, although no significant climate drivers for this were identified. The first high day of the Poaceae pollen season is occurring earlier in central UK regions due to an increasing trend for all temperature variables in the previous December, January, April, May and June. Severity and duration of the season show no significant trends and are spatially and temporally variable. Important changes are occurring in the UK pollen seasons that will impact on the health of respiratory allergy sufferers, with more severe Betula pollen seasons and longer Quercus pollen seasons. Most of the changes identified were caused by climate drivers of increasing temperature and sunshine total. However, Poaceae pollen seasons are neither becoming more severe nor longer.

We analyzed data collected in an internet survey conducted by the Japan Pet Food Association in 2021. Valid data were obtained from 4290 participants for analysis of dog ownership and 4308 participants for analysis of cat ownership. In these respective groups, 41.2% had owned a dog and 26.5% had owned a cat. During the follow-up period, 5.7% of dog owners and 14.8% of non-dog owners developed asthma, as did 5.6% of cat owners and 13.5% of non-cat owners. On binomial logistic regression analysis, participants who had not owned a dog had an odds ratio (OR) of 2.01 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45-2.78) of developing asthma compared to those who had owned a dog after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics. The corresponding OR of asthma onset among participants who had not owned a cat was 2.24 (95%CI: 1.56-3.23). Stratified analysis showed that while younger participants who had not owned a dog had higher ORs of developing asthma, those who had not owned a cat had similar ORs of asthma onset across all age categories.

The <i>in vitro</i> gastrointestinal digestion assay was done to simulate the human upper digestive tract. Selected honeybee pollen extracts (HBPEs) were assessed as bioaccessible fractions during an <i>in vitro</i> gastrointestinal digestion. Contents of phenolic compounds, antioxidant capacity, and recovery index of quercetin, myricetin, and cinnamic acid were monitored in different steps of gastrointestinal digestion.

However, like other cereal crops, the sensitivity of male organ to heat and drought can severely depress sorghum yield due to reduced fertility and pollination efficiency if the stress occurs at the reproductive stage. Identification of the most vulnerable stages and the genes and genetic networks that differentially regulate the abiotic stress responses during anther development are two critical prerequisites for targeted molecular trait selection and for enhanced environmentally resilient sorghum in breeding using a variety of genetic modification strategies.

The most important bioclimatic parameters were the seasonality of the precipitation and the maximum temperature of the warmest month, although orography must also be taken into account.

This complexity is due in a large part to rainfall's twofold impact of having, prior to pollination, a positive influence on subsequent pollen production and of contributing, during pollination, to pollen removal from the air through a wash-out effect. To better explore this impact, we place particular emphasis on extreme rainfall by calculating the correlation between airborne pollen and fungal spore parameters and the precipitation indices that the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) proposed for characterising climate extremes. Parameters for twenty-seven pollen and fungal spore taxa measured in six aerobiological stations in the NE Iberian Peninsula have been considered. We have distinguished between annual and winter ETCCDI in order to compare the correlations between extreme rainfall and airborne pollen concentrations and to avoid the wash-out effect as far as possible. Results show a positive influence from an increase in moderately extreme winter rainfall, specifically on subsequent pollen/fungal spore production: the percentage of all possible significant correlations is higher for winter than for annual rainfall. Furthermore, while annual rainfall in this region has nearly the same number of positive as negative correlations, the positive correlations for winter rainfall are more than twice that of the negative ones. The seasonal consideration on rainfall ETCCDI made with the aim to avoid the confounding overlapping of different rainfall impacts has led to more sharpened observations of its positive and negative effects on airborne pollen and fungal spore concentrations.",10.1007/s00484-022-02267-5,35275236,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:50:18.427196-04:00,No,,

It is also a valuable source of nectar and pollen for entomofauna. The study was carried out to investigate the structure of hypanthial nectaries present in the flowers of this species with the use of light and scanning electron microscopy. Nectary tissues were examined in three stages of flowering, with special focus placed on changes occurring in the epidermis&#xa0;and nectariferous parnechyma. Long-styled flowers, which produce nectar abundantly, were selected for the study. The nectary parenchyma was shown to consist of multiple cell layers (up to 20). The epidermis was initially single-layered, but the number of layers gradually increased to 2-3 during the following days of flowering. The outer walls of epidermis cells were covered by a strongly undulating cuticle with massive striae. Cracks and perforations, which are probably nectar release sites, were visible between the striae. The presence of the secretion in the intercellular spaces between the parenchyma layer and the epidermis may indicate apoplastic nectar transport. The presence of stomata, as well as pores in the cuticle layer of the nectary epidermis, suggests that C. japonica nectar is secreted in two ways: (i) through the nectarostomata and (ii) ordinary epidermis cells with the involvement of the cuticle.",10.1007/s00709-022-01750-5,35260941,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:07:10.224676-04:00,No,,

Resource maps have been proposed as an alternative to land cover maps for prediction of beneficial insects. We aimed at predicting the abundance of crop pest predating insects and the pest control service they provide with both, detailed flower resource maps and land cover maps. We selected 19 landscapes of 500&#xa0;m radius and mapped them with both approaches. In the centres of the landscapes, aphid predators - hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae), ladybeetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) - were surveyed in experimentally established faba bean phytometers (<i>Vicia faba</i> L. Var. Sutton Dwarf) and their control of introduced black bean aphids (<i>Aphis fabae</i> Scop.) was recorded. Landscapes with higher proportions of forest edge as derived from land cover maps supported higher abundance of aphid predators, and high densities of aphid predators reduced aphid infestation on faba bean. Floral resource maps did not significantly predict predator abundance or aphid control services. Land cover maps allowed to relate landscape composition with predator abundance, showing positive effects of forest edges. Floral resource maps may have failed to better predict predators because other resources such as overwintering sites or alternative prey potentially play a more important role than floral resources. More research is needed to further improve our understanding of resource requirements beyond floral resource estimations and our understanding of their role for aphid predators at the landscape scale.

It is unclear how this unbalanced quantity and quality of floral resources affects flower visits and pollen transfer to female flowers. We asked, what characteristics of flowering and dynamics of resource production by trees favour flights of bees between male and female trees. We quantified the floral resources produced by individual flowers and entire trees of Myracrodruon urundeuva (Anacardiaceae), measured pollen flow to female flowers, fruit set of naturally pollinated flowers and determined the effective pollinators. Crown volume of male trees was four-fold, flower number 15-fold and nectar volume 60 times higher than in female trees. While ~70% of male flowers opened in the morning, ~70% of female flowers opened in the afternoon. Fruit set was 27%. Stingless bee species were the main pollinators, while honeybees were common only on male flowers. Strongly unbalanced production of floral resources, high potential lifespan of female flowers and anticipated opening of male flowers favour pollinator movement and pollen deposition on female flowers, albeit low (0.003% of pollen that reached stigmas), but sufficient to produce thousands of fruits per tree. Besides being an astonishing pollen and nectar source for numerous social bee species, only a few of them were effective pollinators.

Immunoblot analysis indicated that the IgE-binding affinity with extracted bee pollen proteins was also significantly decreased after fermentation, suggesting a reduction in the allergenicity of fermented bee pollen. Furthermore, fermentation apparently promoted the biosynthesis of L-valine, L-isoleucine, L-tryptophan, and L-phenylalanine, as well as their precursors or intermediates.

Climate models project altered seasonal precipitation patterns, and thus, the effects of climate change on available resources and pollination services will depend on the season. Plants have evolved reproductive strategies to so they are not limited by either pollen or water availability in their reproductive success, and therefore, we expect that the disruption of climate change might cause plants to be more pollen limited in seasons that become wetter than they were historically. In this study, we conducted a pollen supplementation experiment within the Global Change Experiment Facility (GCEF) in Central Germany. The GCEF experimentally manipulates future climate based on a realistic scenario of climate change for the region (drier summers and wetter springs and falls) in a native grassland ecosystem. We quantified seed production of two perennial species <i>Dianthus carthusianorum</i> and <i>Scabiosa ochroleuca</i> in response to pollination treatments (control, supplement), climate treatments (ambient and future) and season (summer and fall). <i>Dianthus carthusianorum</i> produced more seeds in future climate conditions independent of the season, but only when given supplemental pollen.

We did not find evidence for our specific expectation of higher pollen limitation in the future climate and fall season (i.e., no three-way interaction pollination&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;season&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;climate), which might be explained by the high-drought tolerance and generalized pollination of our focal plant species.

The reduced barometric pressure, oxygen pressure, and air density, the relatively low temperature and humidity, and the increased UV radiation at moderate altitude induce several physiological and immunological adaptation responses. The environmental characteristics of the alpine climate include reduced aeroallergens such as house dust mites (HDM), pollen, fungi, and less air pollution. These combined factors seem to have immunomodulatory effects controlling pathogenic inflammatory responses and favoring less neuro-immune stress in patients with different asthma phenotypes. The extensive multidisciplinary treatment program may further contribute to the observed clinical improvement by AACT in asthma control and quality of life, fewer exacerbations and hospitalizations, reduced need for oral corticosteroids (OCS), improved lung function, decreased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), improved exercise tolerance, and improved sinonasal outcomes.

However, little is known about the molecular basis of this quantitative trait, in contrast with the many studies available on cell differentiation in the stamen. Recently, the first gene responsible for pollen number variation, <i>REDUCED POLLEN NUMBER1</i> (<i>RDP1</i>), was isolated by genome-wide association studies of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and exhibited the signature of natural selection. This gene encodes a homolog of yeast Mrt4 (mRNA turnover4), which is an assembly factor of the large ribosomal subunit. However, no further data were available to link ribosome function to pollen development. Here, we characterized the <i>RDP1</i> gene using the standard <i>A. thaliana</i> accession Col-0. The frameshift mutant, <i>rdp1-3</i> generated by CRISPR/Cas9 revealed the pleiotropic effect of <i>RDP1</i> in flowering, thus demonstrating that this gene is required for a broad range of processes other than pollen development. We found that the natural Col-0 allele conferred a reduced pollen number against the Bor-4 allele, as assessed using the quantitative complementation test, which is more sensitive than transgenic experiments. Together with a historical recombination event in Col-0, which was identified by sequence alignment, these results suggest that the coding sequence of <i>RDP1</i> is the candidate region responsible for the natural phenotypic variation. To elucidate the biological processes in which <i>RDP1</i> is involved, we conducted a transcriptome analysis. We found that genes responsible for ribosomal large subunit assembly/biogenesis were enriched among the differentially regulated genes, which supported the hypothesis that ribosome biogenesis is disturbed in the <i>rdp1-3</i> mutant.

While there was significant pollen limitation across studies, we found little evidence that pollen limitation increases towards plant range edges. Pollen limitation was not stronger towards the tropics, nor at species' equatorward versus poleward range limits. Meta-analysis results are consistent with results from targeted experiments, in which pollen limitation increased significantly towards only 14% of 14 plant range edges, suggesting that pollination contributes to range limits less often than do other interactions.

This was a prospective randomized controlled open-label single-centre trial. 32 SAR patients were randomized to receive a single injection of omalizumab 300-mg approximately two weeks before start of the pollen period (PP) or medication therapy. All patients completed daily questionnaires; recording symptoms, medication use and quality of life (QoL) throughout the observation period. The primary efficacy parameter was the mean daily Combined Symptom and Medication Score (CSMS). Preseasonal omalizumab significantly reduced the changes of mean daily CSMS of nose during the PP (<i>p</i>&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), peak pollen period (PPP) and PP after PPP (PPP-PP) (<i>p</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.002) and Post-PP (<i>p</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.009) compared to standard medication. The proportion of allergy symptoms-relieving medication-free days during PPP-PP was also significantly higher in preseasonal omalizumab-treated group (76.2(16.7-98.8))% than in medication-treated group (19.0(0-71.4))% (<i>p</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.030).

This process is mediated by many transcription factors acting through complex, multi-layered networks. Here, our analysis of functional knockout mutants of interacting basic helix-loop-helix genes Ms23, Ms32, basic helix-loop-helix 122 (bHLH122), and bHLH51 in maize (Zea mays) established that male fertility requires all four genes, expressed sequentially in the tapetum (TP). Not only do they regulate each other, but also they encode proteins that form heterodimers that act collaboratively to guide many cellular processes at specific developmental stages. MS23 is confirmed to be the master factor, as the ms23 mutant showed the earliest developmental defect, cytologically visible in the TP, with the most drastic alterations in premeiotic gene expression observed in ms23 anthers. Notably, the male-sterile ms23, ms32, and bhlh122-1 mutants lack 24-nt phased secondary small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) and the precursor transcripts from the corresponding 24-PHAS loci, while the bhlh51-1 mutant has wild-type levels of both precursors and small RNA products. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that 24-nt phasiRNA biogenesis primarily occurs downstream of MS23 and MS32, both of which directly activate Dcl5 and are required for most 24-PHAS transcription, with bHLH122 playing a distinct role in 24-PHAS transcription.",10.1093/plcell/koac007,35018475,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:04:09.128587-04:00,No,,

In bumble bees (Bombus impatiens), the consumption of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) pollen dramatically reduces infection by the gut protozoan pathogen Crithidia bombi. One hypothesis for the medicinal effect of sunflower pollen is that consumption changes host gut physiological function, causing rapid excretion that flushes C. bombi from the system. We tested the effect of pollen diet and C. bombi infection on gut transit properties using a 2x2 factorial experiment in which bees were infected with C. bombi or not and fed sunflower or wildflower pollen diet. We measured several non-mutually exclusive physiological processes that underlie the insect excretory system, including gut transit time, bi-hourly excretion rate, the total number of excretion events and the total volume of excrement. Sunflower pollen significantly reduced gut transit time in uninfected bees, and increased the total number of excretion events and volume of excrement by 66 % and 68 %, respectively, in both infected and uninfected bees. Here we show that a sunflower pollen diet can affect host physiology gut function, causing more rapid and greater excretion.

Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying gibberellin (GA)-mediated male reproductive development in plants remain unknown. We show here that rice DELLA/SLR1, which encodes the central negative regulator of GA signaling, is essential for rice anther development. The slr1-5 mutant exhibits premature programmed cell death of the tapetum, lacks Ubisch bodies, and has no exine and no mature pollen. SLR1 is mainly expressed in tapetal cells and tetrads, and is required for the appropriate expression of genes encoding key factors of pollen development, which are suggested to be OsMS188-targeted genes. OsMS188 is the main component in the essential genetic program of tapetum and pollen development. Further, we demonstrate that SLR1 interacts with OsMS188 to cooperatively activate the expression of the sporopollenin biosynthesis and transport-related genes CYP703A3, DPW, ABCG15 and PKS1 for rapid formation of pollen walls.

The presence of ND was documented in an allotetraploid grass, <i>Brachypodium hybridum</i> (genome composition DDSS), which is a polyphyletic species that arose from crosses between two putative ancestors that resembled the modern <i>B. distachyon</i> (DD) and <i>B. stacei</i> (SS). In this work, we investigated the developmental stability of ND in <i>B. hybridum</i> genotype 3-7-2 and compared it with the reference genotype ABR113. We addressed the question of whether the ND is established in generative tissues such as pollen mother cells (PMC). We examined condensation of rDNA chromatin by fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization employing state-of-art confocal microscopy. The transcription of rDNA homeologs was determined by reverse-transcription cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence analysis. In ABR113, the ND was stable in all tissues analyzed (primary and adventitious root, leaf, and spikes). In contrast, the 3-7-2 individuals showed a strong upregulation of the S-genome units in adventitious roots but not in other tissues. Microscopic analysis of the 3-7-2 PMCs revealed extensive decondensation of the D-genome loci and their association with the nucleolus in meiosis. As opposed, the S-genome loci were always highly condensed and localized outside the nucleolus.

In this study, we identified six members of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> KCS family expressed in anther. Among them, KCS7, KCS15, and KCS21 were expressed in tapetal cells at anther stages 8-10. Further analysis demonstrated that they act downstream of male sterility 1 (MS1), a regulator of late <i>tapetum</i> development. The <i>kcs7/15/21</i> triple mutant is fertile. Both cellular observation and lipid staining showed pollen coat lipid was decreased in <i>kcs7/15/21</i> triple mutant. After landing on stigma, the wild-type pollen grains were hydrated for about 5 min while the <i>kcs7/15/21</i> triple mutant pollen took about 10 min to hydrate. Pollen tube growth of the triple mutant was also delayed. These results demonstrate that the <i>tapetum</i>-localized KCS proteins are involved in the accumulation of pollen coat lipid and reveal the roles of tapetal-derived pollen coat lipid for pollen-stigma interaction.",10.3389/fpls.2021.770311,34887893,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:10:27.098268-04:00,No,,

It threatens to undermine the last decades of health gains. Rising temperatures, fires, floods and droughts can directly and indirectly cause human pathologies, that are physical and mental. Extreme weather events lead to loss of life, basic life resources and cause severe mental burden. More intense and frequent heat waves due to global warming impact human health and increase mortality, especially for those most vulnerable. The heat-related health risk depends on individual state of health as well as environmental and socioeconomic characteristics of residential areas. Increasing exposure to air pollutants, due to wildfires and anthropogenic emissions, raises respiratory and cardiovascular mortality. Climate warming changes ecosystems and enhances biological invasions that can better adapt to warm environments. Pathogen profiles are changing, transmission and spread of vector-borne diseases as Malaria or Dengue are increasing. Further, rising temperatures and air pollution increase the production and allergenicity of pollen, associated with higher prevalence of allergic diseases. Protective environmental factors, as biodiversity or diverse microbiome, should be given greater consideration in future research.Health sector has the central responsibility as the fifth-largest greenhouse gas emitter to transform in a climate-neutral and sustainable way, e.&#x200a;g. by efficient use of resources.

However, there has been no research on grass pollen allergy in northern China. We aimed to determine the status of grass pollen allergy and the sensitization patterns to <i>Phleum pratense</i> (<i>P. pratense</i>) in northern China. Pollen data were collected for three geographic areas (Beijing, Shenmu, Shizuishan) in northern China. The study enrolled 101 patients (62 men; age range, 1-64 years; median age, 10 years) who had allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma during the grass pollen season and positive skin prick test results positive to <i>P. pratense</i>. Serum-specific IgE (sIgE) against Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, Phl p 6, Phl p 7, Phl p 12 was measured by ImmunoCAP. The pollen season of <i>P. pratense</i> was from June to September in Beijing, May to September in Shenmu and July to August in Shizuishan. <i>P. pratense</i> pollen accounted for 2-3% of the annual pollen index of total pollen counts. Among 101 patients with positive skin prick test results to <i>P. pratense</i>, 72% had detectable sIgE to <i>P. pratense</i>. Phl p 12 was the most frequently recognized component (45%), followed by Phl p 1 (22%), Phl p 5 (14%), Phl p 6 (8%) and Phl p 7 (3%). No patients had sIgE to Phl p 2. Ten sensitization patterns to the six components were observed. High rate of sIgE to Phl p 12 was positively correlated with co-sensitization to weed or tree pollen. Considering the pollen concentration, <i>P. pratense</i> was a minor pollen allergen in northern China and its pollen season overlapped with that of weed pollen.

Therefore, keeping in view the significance of pollen traits, selected taxa of the subfamily Caesalpiniaceae was collected from different geographical regions of Pakistan. The species were then analyzed under both light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques to investigate the importance of micromorphological characters of pollen in the identification and classification of species. Great variation was recorded in equatorial shape, surface ornamentation, tectum, polar diameter, equatorial diameter, and exine thickness. However, little variation was observed in pollen type, polar shape, and fertility of pollen. The equatorial shape of five types was observed: prolate, prolate-spheroidal, spheroidal-subprolate, subspheroidal-prolate, and subspheroidal. Four types of surface ornamentation, psilate, granulate, clavate, and perforate, were recorded. Tectum of five types, intactate, reticulate regulate, medium reticulate, tactate, and striate, was observed. Sexine was thicker than nexine in all studied species. The largest polar diameter was observed in Caesalpinia pulcherrima 64.1&#x2009;&#x3bc;m while the smallest in Parkinsonia aculeata 26.1&#x2009;&#x3bc;m.

In this study, we performed genome-wide analyses of alternative splicing during the meiosis stage in TGMS line BS366 using PacBio and RNA-Seq hybrid sequencing. Cytological observations indicated that cytoskeleton assembly in pollen cells, calcium deposition in pollen and tapetal cells, and vesicle transport in tapetal cells were deficient in BS366. According to our cytological findings, 49 differentially spliced genes were isolated. Moreover, 25 long non-coding RNA targets and three bHLH transcription factors were identified.

To date, there have been few studies on how to resist the toxicity of self-S-RNase. In this study, pollen tube polyamines were found to respond to self-S-RNase and help pollen tubes defend against self-S-RNase. In particular, the contents of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine in the pollen tube treated with self-S-RNase were substantially lower than those treated with non-self-S-RNase. Further analysis of gene expression of key enzymes in the synthesis and degradation pathways of polyamines found that the expression of <i>DIAMINE OXIDASE 4</i> (<i>MdDAO4</i>) as well as several polyamine oxidases such as <i>POLYAMINE OXIDASES 3</i> (<i>MdPAO3</i>), <i>POLYAMINE OXIDASES 4</i> (<i>MdPAO4</i>), and <i>POLYAMINE OXIDASES 6</i> (<i>MdPAO6</i>) were significantly up-regulated under self-S-RNase treatment, resulting in the reduction of polyamines. Silencing <i>MdPAO6</i> in pollen tubes alleviates the inhibitory effect of self-S-RNase on pollen tube growth. In addition, exogenous polyamines also enhance pollen tube resistance to self-S-RNase. Transcriptome sequencing data found that polyamines may communicate with S-RNase through the calcium signal pathway, thereby regulating the growth of the pollen tubes.

However, facilitation via pollinator sharing might be the rule rather than the exception in harsh environments. Moreover, plant diversity could be playing a key role in fostering pollinator-mediated facilitation. Yet, the facilitative effect of plant diversity on pollination remains poorly understood, especially under natural conditions. By examining a total of 9371 stigmas of 88 species from nine high-Andean communities in NW Patagonia, we explored the prevalent sign of the relation between conspecific pollen receipt and heterospecific pollen diversity, and assessed whether the incidence of different outcomes varies with altitude and whether pollen receipt relates to plant diversity. Conspecific pollen receipt increased with heterospecific pollen diversity on stigmas. In all communities, species showed either positive or neutral but never negative relations between the number of heterospecific pollen donor species and conspecific pollen receipt. The incidence of species showing positive relations increased with altitude. Finally, stigmas collected from communities with more co-flowering species had richer heterospecific pollen loads and higher abundance of conspecific pollen grains. Our findings suggest that plant diversity enhances pollination success in high-Andean plant communities. This study emphasizes the importance of plant diversity in fostering indirect plant-plant facilitative interactions in alpine environments, which could promote species coexistence and biodiversity maintenance.",10.1038/s41598-021-01611-w,34764375,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:58:58.239717-04:00,No,,

Today, breathing in the microclimate of caves with their stable air temperature and moderate to high humidity in the presence of sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium and the absence of airborne pollutants and pollen is called speleotherapy. The inhalation of natural pure sodium chloride (NaCl) in a controlled environment (air temperature 18&#xb0; to 24&#xb0;C and relative humidity 40% to 60%) is called halotherapy. The main active ingredient in halo- and speleotherapy is NaCl aerosol particles, which penetrate all layers of the respiratory tract. In addition to their antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, salt particles also facilitate mucociliary transport and reduce immunogloblin E (IgE) levels. Clinical trials have confirmed that salt therapy is an effective option for relieving symptoms and improving functional parameters in sinusitis, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, mild and moderate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Rinsing with hypertonic saline has been found to be beneficial in reducing airway inflammation in patients with bronchiolitis.

We documented for the first time the impacts of over three decades of land cover change in Mexico on the plant resources of an endangered migratory pollinator, the Mexican long-nosed bat, <i>Leptonycteris nivalis</i>. This species is considered endangered under national and international criteria due to population declines over 50% in the past 10 years. Pregnant females of this bat species migrate every year following the blooms of <i>Agave</i> spp. from central Mexico to the southern United States; moving pollen over its 1,200 km long migratory corridor and pollinating distant populations of <i>Agave</i> spp. Increases in human populations density and agricultural expansion may be reducing agave habitat over time. The objective of our study is to understand the land cover change trends in the northern range of the bat and identify potential fragmentation patterns in the region. We analyzed changes that occurred in three vegetation types where agaves are found in five time periods 1985, 1993, 2002, 2007 and 2011. The area of the three vegetation types selected was reduced by using only the overlap with potential agave habitat created with ecological niche modeling algorithms to obtain the available agave habitat. We then calculated fragmentation metrics for each period. We found a significant portion of habitat lost mainly due to expansion in agriculture. The total number of patches increased after 1985. Only 9% of the available agave habitat in 2011 is inside the limits of protected areas.

Triana has pseudocampanulate flowers with bulbous stamen appendages, typical for the passerine pollination syndrome found in the Melastomataceae tribe Merianieae. The species is further characterized by strong stamen dimorphism (heteranthery), a condition otherwise associated with pollen-rewarding bee-pollinated species (both in Melastomataceae and beyond). In passerine-pollinated Merianieae, however, flowers usually only show weak stamen dimorphism. Here, we conducted field and laboratory investigations to determine the pollinators of <i>M. macrophylla</i> and assess the potential role of strong heteranthery in this species. Our field observations in Costa Rica confirmed syndrome predictions and indeed proved pollination by passerine birds in <i>M. macrophylla</i>. The large bulbous set of stamens functions as a food-body reward to the pollinating birds, and as trigger for pollen release (bellows mechanism) as typical for the passerine syndrome in Merianieae. In contrast to other passerine-pollinated Merianieae, the second set of stamens has seemingly lost its rewarding and pollination function, however.

This approach, combined with high invertebrate toxicity for newer products like neonicotinoids, makes it challenging to conserve beneficial insects and the services that they provide. We used a 4-y experiment using commercial-scale fields replicated across multiple sites in the midwestern United States to evaluate the consequences of adopting integrated pest management (IPM) using pest thresholds compared with standard conventional management (CM). To do so, we employed a systems approach that integrated coproduction of a regionally dominant row crop (corn) with a pollinator-dependent specialty crop (watermelon). Pest populations, pollination rates, crop yields, and system profitability were measured. Despite higher pest densities and/or damage in both crops, IPM-managed pests rarely reached economic thresholds, resulting in 95% lower insecticide use (97 versus 4 treatments in CM and IPM, respectively, across all sites, crops, and years). In IPM corn, the absence of a neonicotinoid seed treatment had no impact on yields, whereas IPM watermelon experienced a 129% increase in flower visitation rate by pollinators, resulting in 26% higher yields. The pollinator-enhancement effect under IPM management was mediated entirely by wild bees; foraging by managed honey bees was unaffected by treatments and, overall, did not correlate with crop yield. This proof-of-concept experiment mimicking on-farm practices illustrates that cropping systems in major agricultural commodities can be redesigned via IPM to exploit ecosystem services without compromising, and in some cases increasing, yields.",10.1073/pnas.2108429118,34697238,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 12:58:38.136725-04:00,No,,

Although research in tobacco has shown that decreased activity of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) results in the morphological change of pollen tube vacuole, whether DGK regulates the pollen tube vacuole of tree plants and whether it occurs in SI response, is currently unclear. We found that DGK activity is essential for pear pollen tube growth, and DGK4 regulates pollen tube vacuole morphology following its high expression and deposition at the tip and shank edge of the pollen tube of pear. Specifically, incompatible S-RNase may induce cytoplasmic acidification of the pollen tube by inhibiting V-ATPase V<sub>0</sub> domain a1 subunit gene expression as early as 30&#x2009;min after treatment, when the pollen tube is still alive.

Pollen grains mature into two distinct subpopulations - those that display high metabolic activity and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels immediately after hydration (high-ROS/active), and those that maintain an extended period of dormancy with low metabolic activity (low-ROS/inactive/arrested/dormant). We propose that the dormant pollen serves as a backup to provide a second chance for successful fertilization when the 'first wave' of pollen encounters an unpredictable growth condition such as heat stress. This model provides a framework for considering the role of dormancy in reproductive stress tolerance as well as strategies for mitigating pollen thermovulnerability to daytime and night-time warming that is associated with global climate change.",10.1016/j.tplants.2021.09.002,34627662,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 17:55:43.616721-04:00,No,,

A hypothesis previously proposed is that RI in plants may occur by ovule usurpation, in which pistils lack interspecific incompatibility and mistakenly accept heterospecific pollen, thereby losing an opportunity for conspecific pollen fertilization. However, few comparative studies have evaluated the consistency of the inferred mechanism within and among individuals and populations. We conducted hand-pollination experiments in six populations of three native Taraxacum species that suffered from different levels of RI from an alien congener, T. officinale, and compared pollen-pistil interactions among populations. We also investigated the interactions for eight individual T. japonicum plants whose response to heterospecific pollen deposition had been previously measured. Our results revealed that pollen tubes often penetrated native ovaries following heterospecific pollination in populations suffering from strong RI, whereas they seldom did in populations suffering from marginal RI. However, the relative frequency of the pollen tube penetration was not significantly related to the strength of alien RI. Not all pistils on an individual plant showed the same pollen receptivity following heterospecific pollination; rather, some accepted and some refused the pollen tubes. The relationship between pollen tube penetration following heterospecific pollination and the strength of the alien RI was also not significant among individuals. Our present results generally support the ovule usurpation hypothesis, but suggest that other factors, such as competition for pollinator services, variation in the effects of heterospecific pollen donors, and condition of the native inflorescences, might also affect the observed RI strength.",10.1007/s10265-021-01352-x,34609645,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:48:17.494487-04:00,No,,

Rab proteins are geranylgeranylated at their C-termini, a modification which is important for their stable binding to lipid bilayers. The Rab escort protein (REP) is an accessory protein of the Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (RGT) complex and it is obligatory for Rab prenylation. While REP-Rab interactions have been studied by biochemical, structural, and genetic methods in animals and yeast, data on the plant RGT complex are still limited. Here we use hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to describe the structural basis of plant REP-Rab binding. The obtained results show that the interaction of REP with Rabs is highly dynamic and involves specific structural changes in both partners. In some cases the Rab and REP regions involved in the interaction are molecule-specific, and in other cases they are common for a subset of Rabs. In particular, the C-terminus of REP is not involved in binding of unprenylated Rab proteins in plants, in contrast to mammalian REP. In line with this, a C-terminal REP truncation does not have pronounced phenotypic effects in planta. On the contrary, a complete lack of functional REP leads to male sterility in Arabidopsis: pollen grains develop in the anthers, but they do not germinate efficiently and hence are unable to transmit the mutated allele.

Here, we present high-resolution palynological and lithological data of a peatland's sedimentary profile in the central Sanjiang Plain. The study aims to reconstruct the local terrestrialization process and discuss its significance to the Holocene East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) evolution. The results indicate that a paleolake surrounded by broadleaved forests developed during ~7.4-4.5&#xa0;ka BP, corresponding to a wet and warm stage with strengthened EASM. Thereafter, a wetland dominated by Cyperaceae and Poaceae was initiated with the terrestrialization process. This process lasted until 3.9&#xa0;ka BP when a lithological mud-to-peat transition occurred indicating a peatland began to develop after the extinction of the paleolake. Considering the prevalent EASM climate on the modern Sanjiang Plain, this paleolake-to-peatland transition during 4.5-3.9&#xa0;ka BP was attributed to the mid-Holocene EASM retreat in addition to the paleolake's autogenic infilling process. During the peatland developing stage, four dry intervals with weakened EASM occurred in 3.9-3.2&#xa0;ka BP, 2.0-1.3&#xa0;ka BP, 1.0-0.5&#xa0;ka BP, and 0.1-0.0&#xa0;ka BP.

However, maintaining flowers costs energy and resources. Therefore, flower longevity, the length of time a flower remains viable, is critical for the outcome of plant reproduction. Although previous studies showed that the evolution of flower longevity depends on the rates of pollen deposition and removal, whether plants should increase or decrease flower life span when the pollination environment is unpredictable has not been explored. Moreover, the common hypothesis that an unpredictable pollination environment should select for increased flower longevity may be too simplistic since there is no distinction drawn between the effects of spatial and temporal variation. Adopting evolutionary game theory, we investigate the evolution of flower longevity under three types of variation: spatial heterogeneity, daily fluctuations within a flowering season and yearly fluctuations between flowering seasons. We find that spatial heterogeneity often selects for a shorter flower lifespan, while temporal fluctuations of fitness accrual rates at both daily and yearly time scales tends to favour greater longevity, although daily and yearly fluctuations have somewhat different effects. However, the presence of correlation between female and male fitness accrual rates seems to have no effect on flower longevity.

Regardless of species, insects share the presence of a group of morphologically conserved neuropils known collectively as the central complex (CX). The CX is a navigational center, involved in sensory integration and coordinated motor activity. Despite the fact that our understanding of navigational behavior comes predominantly from ants and bees, most of what we know about the underlying neural circuitry of such behavior comes from work in fruit flies. Here, we aim to close this gap, by providing the first comprehensive map of all major columnar neurons and their projection patterns in the CX of a bee. We find numerous components of the circuit that appear to be highly conserved between the fly and the bee, but also highlight several key differences which are likely to have important functional ramifications. Bumblebees forage widely for pollen and nectar from flowers, sometimes travelling kilometers away from their nest, but they can somehow always find their way home in a nearly straight line. These insects have been known to return to their nest from new locations almost 10 kilometers away. This homing ability is a complex neurological feat and requires the brain to combine several processes, including observing the external world, controlling bodily movements and drawing on memory. While the navigational behavior of bees has been well-studied, the neuronal circuitry behind it has not. Unfortunately, most of what is known about insects&#x2019; brain activity comes from studies in species such as locusts or fruit flies. In these species, a region of the brain known as the central complex has been shown to have an essential role in homing behaviors. However, it is unknown how similar the central complex of bumblebees might be to fruit flies&#x2019; or locusts&#x2019;, or how these differences may affect navigational abilities. Sayre et al. obtained images of thin slices of the bumblebee central complex using a technique called block-face electron microscopy, which produces high-resolution image volumes. These images were used to obtain a three-dimensional map of over 1300 neurons. This cellular atlas showed that key aspects of the central complex are nearly identical between flies and bumblebees, including the internal compass that monitors what direction the insect is travelling in. However, hundreds of millions of years of independent evolution have resulted in some differences. These were found in neurons possibly involved in forming memories of the directions and lengths of travelled paths, and in the circuits that use such vector memories to steer the insects towards their targets.

To improve the quality and yield of flowers, it is very important to carry out cross-breeding between different petal types of jasmine. However, because of the difficulty of sexual reproduction, there is no report on the success of jasmine crosses. In this paper, single- and double-petal jasmine plants were crossed artificially. The stigmas of single-petal plants post pollination, including those at 0&#xa0;h after pollination (CK), 1&#xa0;h after pollination (T1) and 6&#xa0;h after pollination (T2), were sequenced by transcriptomic combined with proteomic analyses. A total of 178,098 gene products were assembled. Simultaneously, a total of 2337 protein species were identified. Some regulatory gene products and functional protein species were identified that may be involved in the process of pollen-pistil interactions. These findings suggest that the identified differentially expressed gene products and differentially accumulated protein species may play vital roles in jasmine plants in response to pollen-pistil interactions, providing important genetic resources for further functional dissection of the molecular mechanisms of these interactions. SIGNIFICANCE: These results have important scientific significance to take effective measures to overcome pre-fertilization barriers and to guide the cross breeding of jasmine. Further, they can also be used for reference in other plant breeding with the same fertilization barriers.",10.1016/j.jprot.2021.104380,34517123,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:14:08.462985-04:00,No,,

We propose a new multimodal approach that combines electrical sensing and optical imaging to classify pollen grains flowing in a microfluidic chip at a throughput of 150 grains per second. Electrical signals and synchronized optical images are processed by two independent machine learning-based classifiers, whose predictions are then combined to provide the final classification outcome. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in a proof-of-concept classification experiment involving eight pollen classes from different taxa. The average balanced accuracy is 78.7% for the electrical classifier, 76.7% for the optical classifier and 84.2% for the multimodal classifier. The accuracy is 82.8% for the electrical classifier, 84.1% for the optical classifier and 88.3% for the multimodal classifier. The multimodal approach provides better classification results with respect to the analysis based on electrical or optical features alone. The proposed methodology paves the way for automated multimodal palynology.

However, in some cases, they can mediate fruit set. Some plants face severe pollen-limited fecundity and any additional fruit set, even if from self-pollination, can be advantageous. This is the case in some tropical deceptive orchids, such as the threatened Cyrtopodium hatschbachii. Here we test the hypothesis that florivory of the anther cap would facilitate rain-assisted autogamy in this species. In the field, we followed flowers in which the anther cap was removed by the orthopteran Stenopola sp. and found cases where pollinia self-deposited after rainfall and in one case this resulted in swelling of the column typical of fruit development. This event comprised 33% of all fruit set in the population in 2019. We then experimentally varied anther cap removal and rainfall in a factorial design and found increased fruit set in the group with cap removal (simulated florivory) followed by rain. The water absorption by pollinia makes them heavier, causing the stipe to bend. The droplet of water on the stigma then shrinks and pulls the pollinia back onto the stigma, causing self-pollination. Seeds from self-pollination have considerable viability and may allow population persistence, given that bee-mediated cross-pollination is uncertain and even absent in some years. Our study provides a unique example of how two unrelated factors (i.e., florivory and rain) that are detrimental alone may together promote fruit set.",10.1007/s00114-021-01752-y,34477965,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:28:47.223700-04:00,No,,

During the middle of last century, triggered by the realization that genetic erosion was threatening the existing landraces and wild relatives of the major food crops, global efforts to collect and conserve the genetic diversity of these threatened resources were initiated, predominantly orchestrated by FAO. National and international genebanks were established to store and maintain germplasm materials, conservation methodologies were created, standards developed, and coordinating efforts were put in place to ensure effective and efficient approaches and collaboration. In the spontaneously developing global conservation system, plant breeders played an important role, aiming at the availability of genetic diversity in their breeding work. Furthermore, long-term conservation and the safety of the collected materials were the other two overriding criteria that led to the emerging international network of ex situ base collections. The political framework for the conservation of plant genetic resources finds its roots in the International Undertaking of the FAO and became 'turbulent rapid' with the conclusion of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

The Physalis fruit features a morphological novelty, the Chinese lantern. Floral C-class MADS-domain AGAMOUS-like (AG-like) proteins can interact with the identified regulators of this novel structure. However, the developmental role of the floral C-class genes is unknown in Physalis. Here, we characterized two AG-like genes from Physalis floridana, designated PFAG1 and PFAG2. The two paralogous genes shared around 61.0% of sequence identity and had similar expression domains, with different expression levels in the floral and berry development. However, the genes had distinct expression patterns in leaf and calyx development. Protein-protein interaction analyses revealed that PFAG1 and PFAG2 could commonly or specifically dimerize with certain floral MADS-domain proteins as well as non-MADS-domain proteins involved in various floral developmental processes. Gene downregulation analyses demonstrated that PFAG1 may repress PFAG2, but PFAG2 did not affect PFAG1. Downregulating PFAG1 led to incomplete floral homeotic variation in the stamens and carpels, and alteration of petal coloration pattern, while downregulating PFAG2 did not result in any floral homeotic variation. PFAG1 affected pollen maturation, while PFAG2 affected female fertility. However, simultaneously downregulating PFAG1 and PFAG2 caused loss of the complete C-function, indicating that the two PFAG genes interact to determine the identity and functionality of androecia and gynoecia organs. Their potential roles in regulating fruit size and the Chinese lantern are also discussed.

On-the-spot diagnosis of sex is important to breeders and farmers for crop improvement and maximizing yield, yet diagnostic tools at the seedling stage are understudied and lack a scientific basis. Understanding sexual dimorphism in juvenile plants may provide key ecological, evolutionary and economic insights into dioecious plant species in addition to improving the process of crop cultivation. To address this gap in the literature, we asked: can we reliably differentiate males, females, and co-sexual individuals based on seedling morphology in Cannabis sativa, and do the traits used to distinguish sex at this stage vary between genotypes? To answer these questions, we collected data on phenotypic traits of 112 C. sativa plants (50 female, 52 male, 10 co-sexuals) from two hemp cultivars (CFX-1, CFX-2) during the second week of vegetative growth and used ANOVAs to compare morphology among sexes. We found males grew significantly longer hypocotyls than females by week 2, but this difference depended on the cultivar investigated. Preliminary evidence suggests that co-sexual plants may be distinguished from male and female plants using short hypocotyl length and seedling height, although this relationship requires more study since sample sizes of co-sexual plants were small. In one of the cultivars, two-week old male plants tend to produce longer hypocotyls than other plants, which may help to identify these plants prior to anthesis. We call for increased research effort on co-sexual plants, given their heavy economic cost in industrial contexts and rare mention in the literature. Our preliminary data suggests that short hypocotyl length may be an indicator of co-sexuality. These results are the first steps towards developing diagnostic tools for predicting sex using vegetative morphology in dioecious species and understanding how sexual dimorphism influences phenotype preceding sexual maturity.",10.1038/s41598-021-96311-w,34413374,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:03:15.069016-04:00,No,,

Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), a major vegetable crop, is highly susceptible to conditions of heat stress. When tomato plants are exposed to ambient day/night temperatures that exceed 32 &#xb0;C/20 &#xb0;C, respectively, during the reproductive phase, fruit set and fruit weight are reduced, leading to a significant decrease in yield. Processing tomato cultivars are cultivated in open fields, where environmental conditions are not controlled; therefore, plants are exposed to multiple abiotic stresses, including heat stress. Nonetheless, information on stress response in processing tomatoes is very limited. Understanding the physiological response of modern processing tomato cultivars to heat stress may facilitate the development of thermotolerant cultivars. Here, we compared two tomato processing cultivars, H4107 and H9780, that we found to be constantly differing in yield performance. Using field and temperature-controlled greenhouse experiments, we show that the observed difference in yield is attributed to the occurrence of heat stress conditions. In addition, fruit set and seed production were significantly higher in the thermotolerant cultivar H4107, compared with H9780. Despite the general acceptance of pollen viability as a measure of thermotolerance, there was no difference in the percentage of viable pollen between H4107 and H9780 under either of the conditions tested. In addition to observations of similar pollen germination and bud abscission rates, our results suggest that processing tomato cultivars may present a particular case, in which pollen performance is not determining reproductive thermotolerance. Our results also demonstrate the value of combining controlled and uncontrolled experimental settings, in order to validate and identify heat stress-related responses, thus facilitating the development of thermotolerant processing tomato cultivars.",10.1093/aobpla/plab046,34394907,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:04:30.840510-04:00,No,,

We assessed the survival of phenotypes representing a continuum between the two pure species in a natural hybrid swarm after 29 years, along with seedling recruitment. The performance of pure species as well as of artificial and natural hybrids was also assessed over 28 years in a common garden trial. In the hybrid zone, E. amygdalina adults showed greater mortality than E. risdonii, and the current seedling cohort is still dominated by E. risdonii phenotypes. Morphologically intermediate individuals appeared to be the least fit. Similar results were observed after growing artificial first-generation and natural hybrids alongside pure species families in a common garden trial. Here, the survival, reproduction, health and growth of the intermediate hybrids were significantly less than those of either pure species, consistent with hybrid inferiority, although this did not manifest until later reproductive ages. Among the variable progeny of natural intermediate hybrids, the most E. risdonii-like phenotypes were the most fit. This study contributes to the increasing number of reports of hybrid inferiority in Eucalyptus, suggesting that post-zygotic barriers contribute to the maintenance of species integrity even between closely related species. However, with fitness rapidly recovered following backcrossing, it is argued that hybridization can still be an important evolutionary process, in the present case appearing to contribute to the range expansion of the rare E. risdonii in response to climate change.",10.1093/aob/mcab103,34351372,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:17:55.982041-04:00,No,,

However, theory's relevance to mutualism stability in nature is controversial. Detailed comparative studies of parasitic species that are embedded within otherwise mutualistic taxa (e.g., fig pollinator wasps) can identify factors that potentially promote or undermine mutualism stability. We describe results from behavioral, morphological, phylogenetic, and experimental studies of two functionally distinct, but closely related, <i>Eupristina</i> wasp species associated with the monoecious host fig, <i>Ficus microcarpa</i>, in Yunnan Province, China. One (<i>Eupristina verticillata</i>) is a competent pollinator exhibiting morphologies and behaviors consistent with observed seed production. The other (<i>Eupristina</i> sp.) lacks these traits, and dramatically reduces both female and male reproductive success of its host. Furthermore, observations and experiments indicate that individuals of this parasitic species exhibit greater relative fitness than the pollinators, in both indirect competition (individual wasps in separate fig inflorescences) and direct competition (wasps of both species within the same fig). Moreover, phylogenetic analyses suggest that these two <i>Eupristina</i> species are sister taxa. By the strictest definition, the nonpollinating species represents a """"cheater"""" that has descended from a beneficial pollinating mutualist. In sharp contrast to all 15 existing studies of actively pollinated figs and their wasps, the local <i>F. microcarpa</i> exhibit no evidence for host sanctions that effectively reduce the relative fitness of wasps that do not pollinate. We suggest that the lack of sanctions in the local hosts promotes the loss of specialized morphologies and behaviors crucial for pollination and, thereby, the evolution of cheating.""",10.1073/pnas.2021148118,34341115,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:19:33.501267-04:00,No,,

Colonizers of small, remote oceanic islands should be initially rare, extremely mate-limited and often without pollinators. Hence, plant communities on such islands should reflect an establishment history in which young 'naturalized' species are most likely to display self-compatibility and autonomous selfing, whereas 'indigenous' species may exhibit more diverse reproductive strategies. To test this prediction, we characterized breeding systems of 28 species on Pohnpei, in the Federated States of Micronesia, a group of remote Pacific islands that are considered a global biodiversity hotspot. Three families with both naturalized and indigenous species were selected-Fabaceae, Malvaceae and Melastomataceae. Measurements included field observations of dichogamy/herkogamy and floral attraction traits, pollen:ovule (<i>P:O</i>) ratios and experimental hand-pollinations for self-compatibility and pollen limitation. Phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses tested for trait correlations between naturalized and indigenous species. Flowers of all 28 species were bisexual, and pollinator attraction features were common. Pollen:ovule ratios ranged from 9 to 557 (median = 87), and all 11 hand-pollinated species were self-compatible. All species had &gt;5 ovules and &lt;3500 pollen grains per flower. Indigenous species did not differ significantly from naturalized species for any trait. There is a dearth of data from remote islands bearing on the question of establishment history. In this study, we inferred all species to have some degree of autogamy and indigenous species were no more likely than naturalized species to display outcrossing mechanisms. On Pohnpei, high ovule numbers, and the inaccessibility of wind pollination and obligate outcrossing strategies, reflect the importance of retaining reproductive assurance mechanisms in the face of pollinator uncertainty.",10.1093/aobpla/plab038,34336178,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:47:09.545311-04:00,No,,

We used daily pollen count concentrations from a National Allergy Bureau pollen counting station located in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, for 13 allergenic taxa.

In multiple species, pollen seasons trended toward an earlier release throughout the 27-year period. Variations in seasonal climate did have an effect on pollen counts and the timing of pollen release but varied by taxa.

Zucchini was grown in soil amended with nano-CuO, bulk CuO (100 mg Kg<sup>-1</sup>), and CuSO<sub>4</sub> (320 mg Kg<sup>-1</sup>) from germination to flowering (60 days). Nano-CuO treatment had no impact on plant morphology or growth nor pollen formation and viability. The uptake of Cu was comparable in the plant tissues under all treatments.

Therefore, these assays represent an essential tool that mimics the in vivo degranulation process, which occurs upon allergen exposure in sensitized patients or in skin prick tests. Additionally, these assays are usually employed to investigate the allergenic potential of proteins and the reactivity of patients' sera's reactivity.

However, their effects on higher trophic levels (e.g. insects) remain largely unclear. In this study, by field sampling in the Hengduan Mountains (HDM) in southwestern China, we evaluated the effects of an alpine gynodioecious cushion species, Arenaria polytrichoides (Carophyllaceae), on insect richness, abundance and population dynamics at two different elevations (4427&#xa0;m vs. 4732&#xa0;m) separately at two time periods (day vs. night) and in two growing seasons (early vs. late). The results showed that the total insect diversity decreases from low to high elevation sites. Some insect species were exclusively detected within A. polytrichoides cushions, leading to an increase in local insect richness from 7% to 35%. The positive effects of cushions on insect diversity could be attributed to unique biotic properties provided by cushions. Firstly, the effects were determined by the sexual dimorphism of the cushion with hermaphroditic cushions supporting higher insect diversity than female cushions. This could be because hermaphroditic cushions provide more resources, such as nectar and pollen grains, for insects than female cushions. Secondly, the cushions' associated beneficiary plants can also provide extra resources for attracting more insects, but this effect was mediated by the micro-environmental conditions. Finally, the magnitude of cushions' positive effects on insect dynamics were stronger under higher than under lower environmental stress. This study confirmed that facilitation by A. polytrichoides cushions in HDM plays an important role in constructing the alpine insect community and further regulating its dynamics. Moreover, the positive effects of cushions on insect dynamics increase with increasing environmental stress. Therefore, the distribution range of insects would quite possibly be expanded into higher elevation under future climate changes, which will induce new challenges for the local alpine ecosystems.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143091,33213902,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:04:15.057636-04:00,No,,

The current tools for identifying the pollens that bees carry have different strengths and weaknesses when used for ecological inference. In this study we use three methods to better understand a system of congeneric, coflowering plants in the genus Clarkia and their bee pollinators: observations of plant-pollinator contact in the field, and two different molecular methods to estimate the relative abundance of each Clarkia pollen in samples collected from pollinators. We use these methods to investigate if observations of plant-pollinator contact in the field correspond to the pollen bees carry; if individual bees carry Clarkia pollens in predictable ways, based on previous knowledge of their foraging behaviors; and how the three approaches differ for understanding plant-pollinator interactions. We find that observations of plant-pollinator contact are generally predictive of the pollens that bees carry while foraging, and network topologies using the three different methods are statistically indistinguishable from each other. Results from molecular pollen analysis also show that while bees can carry multiple species of Clarkia at the same time, they often carry one species of pollen.

We investigated the use of pollen metabarcoding to identify the floral sources and local foraging preferences of honeybees using 15 honey samples from six bioregions from eastern and western Australia. We used two plant metabarcoding markers, ITS2 and the trnL P6 loop. Both markers combined identified a total of 55 plant families, 67 genera, and 43 species. The trnL P6 loop marker provided significantly higher detection of taxa, detecting an average of 15.6 taxa per sample, compared to 4.6 with ITS2.

We found that eastern and western honeys could be clearly differentiated by their floral composition, and clustered into bioregions with the trnL marker.

He had had intermittent vomiting since 2 years of age. At 7 years of age, he experienced an episode of itchiness of the lips and throat for the first time, followed by vomiting, immediately after ingesting some raw fruits. We diagnosed PFAS based on the skin prick test at 8 years of age and diagnosed EoE by esophagogastroduodenoscopy 11 months after the diagnose of PFAS.

MicroRNA-155 (miRNA-155) has an essential role in regulating gene expression and can mediate the allergic TH2 process. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of miR-155 as a biomarker in AR and correlate its level with the total nasal symptom score (TNSS) and the levels of serum interleukin-4 (IL-4). This study included 90 children: 45 with pollen-induced AR and 45 healthy controls. Serum miR-155 expression levels were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Human IL-4 ELIZA kits were used for the semiquantitative detection of the serum levels of IL-4. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the best cutoff values for the studied parameters for the diagnosis of AR. The demographic characteristics of the two groups were matched with respect to age and sex. The AR case group included 23 (51.1%) males and 22 (48.9%) females, while the control group included 24 (53.3%) males and 21 (46.7%) females. The miR-155 level was increased in the serum of children with pollen-induced AR compared with controls (mean difference&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.8, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). A significant positive correlation between the serum expression level of miR-155 and TNSS in children with AR was detected (<i>r</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.494, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). However, no significant correlation was identified between the expression of miR-155 and that of IL-4. At a cutoff value of 1.09, the sensitivity of miR-155 as a biomarker for AR was 100%, and the specificity was 71.1%. MiR-155 expression levels were elevated in the serum of AR children. Therefore, miR-155 could be used as a biomarker in AR diagnosis.",10.1155/2021/5554461,34221208,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 12:59:02.934048-04:00,No,,

In this study, we evaluated seasonal variation in the concentration of both grass pollen and Phl p 5 allergens as well as the ratio allergen/pollen (pollen potency) in the air of Bratislava during two consecutive years, 2019-2020. These 2 years differed in terms of air pollution, as COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020 considerably improved air quality in the study area. Air samples were collected using a Hirst-type sampler for pollen detection and the cyclone sampler for aeroallergen detection. In 2020, we observed 80.3% higher seasonal pollen integral, probably associated with the longer pollen season duration, however, 43.6% lower mean daily pollen potency than in 2019. The mean daily pollen value was 37.5% higher in 2020 than in the previous year, while the mean daily allergen value was 14.9% lower in 2020. To evaluate the relationship between the amount of pollen or allergen in the air and selected meteorological factors and air pollution parameters, we used multiple regression analysis. Regarding weather factors, precipitation and relative humidity were significantly associated with pollen and/or allergen concentration, though these associations were negative. Atmospheric pollutants, especially CO, NO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> were significantly associated with pollen and/or allergen levels. The associations with CO and O<sub>3</sub> were positive, while the association with NO<sub>2</sub> was negative.

In this study, the antimicrobial actions of eight different honeys from Lemnos island (north-eastern Greece) plus manuka honey (from New Zealand, UMF 30+, licensed in many countries as topical medical preparation) were evaluated against 10 clinically relevant bacteria, including five Gram-positive and five Gram-negative. To achieve this, an agar well diffusion assay measured the diameter of inhibition zones (mm) of two selected concentrations for each honey (25% and 12.5% <i>v/v</i>). The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) of each sample were also calculated and compared against two representative bacterial species (<i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>) using broth microdilution and agar spot methods, respectively. The pH, water activity (a<sub>w</sub>), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and diastase levels, together with the pollen type and content of each honey, were also determined. Results revealed that all the Lemnos honeys presented antibacterial action, which for some samples was like that of manuka.

Concomitant climate change fosters the spreading of the latter on a global scale. The increase in allergens not only aggravates the symptoms and the degree of suffering for patients who already are allergic, but also gives rise to new cases of allergies. The distribution of allergies in society follows a steep socioeconomic gradient worldwide. According to well-established theories of justice such a distribution of the allergy burden is unfair. This fact adds a major ethical dimension and challenge to the allergy epidemic. This chapter draws on the key points of policies for allergy prevention and treatment.

Allergen-specific immune responses are initiated when peptide:MHCII complexes on dendritic cells are recognized by antigen-specific receptors on T cells followed by interactions between costimulatory molecules on the surfaces of B and T cells. In the presence of IL-4, such T-B cell interactions result in clonal expansion and isotype class-switching to IgE in B cells, which will further differentiate into either memory B cells or PCs. Allergic reactions are then triggered upon cross-linking of IgE-Fc&#x25b;RI complexes on basophils and mast cells, leading to cell degranulation and the release of pro-inflammatory mediators.Mechanisms underlying effective allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) involve the induction of Tregs and the secretion of blocking IgG4 antibodies, which together mediate the onset and maintenance of immune tolerance towards non-hazardous environmental antigens. However, the importance of regulatory B cells (Breg) for tolerance induction during AIT has gained more attention lately. Studies in grass pollen- and house dust mite-allergic patients undergoing SCIT reported increased frequencies of IL-10+ Breg cells and a positive correlation between their number and the improvement of clinical symptoms. Thus, Breg are emerging as biomarkers for monitoring tolerance to allergens under natural exposure conditions and during AIT. Further research on the role of other anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by Breg will help to understand their role in disease development and tolerance induction.",10.1007/164_2021_479,34196808,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:44:00.597333-04:00,No,,

Here, we present a new aperture factor, INP2, which satisfies the criteria for being a species-specific partner for INP1. Both INP proteins display similar structural features, including the plant-specific DOG1 domain, similar patterns of expression and mutant phenotypes, as well as signs of co-evolution.

Phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD activity, is a vital signaling molecule. PLD-mediated lipid signaling has been the subject of extensive research leading to discovery of its crystal structure. PLDs are involved in the pathophysiology of several human diseases, therefore, viewed as promising targets for drug design. The availability of a eukaryotic PLD crystal structure will encourage PLD targeted drug designing. PLDs have been implicated in plants response to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the molecular mechanism of response is not clear. Recently, several novel findings have shown that PLD mediated modulation of structural and developmental processes, such as: stomata movement, root growth and microtubule organization are crucial for plants adaptation to environmental stresses. Involvement of PLDs in regulating membrane remodeling, auxin mediated alteration of root system architecture and nutrient uptake to combat nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies and magnesium toxicity is established. PLDs via vesicle trafficking modulate cytoskeleton and exocytosis to regulate self-incompatibility (SI) signaling in flowering plants, thereby contributes to plants hybrid vigor and diversity. In addition, the important role of PLDs has been recognized in biotechnologically important functions, including oil/TAG synthesis and maintenance of seed quality. In this review, we describe the crystal structure of a plant PLD and discuss the molecular mechanism of catalysis and activity regulation.

To date, little information about the molecular mechanisms underlying bolting is available for this important medicinal plant. To identify genes putatively involved in early bolting, we have conducted the transcriptome analysis of the shoot tips of the early-bolting plants and non-bolting (normal) plants of A. sinensis, respectively, using a combination of third-generation sequencing and next-generation sequencing. A total of 43,438 non-redundant transcripts were collected and 475 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified.

N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most frequent mRNA modification and plays multiple physiological functions in plant development. However, whether m<sup>6</sup>A regulates pollen development is unclear, and its putative role in cold stress response remains unknown. Here, we observed that moderate low-temperature (MLT) stress induced pollen abortion in tomato. This phenotype was caused by disruption of tapetum development and pollen exine formation, accompanied by reduced m<sup>6</sup>A levels in tomato anther. Analysis of m<sup>6</sup>A-seq data revealed 1,805 transcripts displayed reduced m<sup>6</sup>A levels and 978 transcripts showed elevated m<sup>6</sup>A levels in MLT-stressed anthers compared with those in anthers under normal temperature.

Whether HOPS and CORVET control endomembrane trafficking in pollen tubes, the fastest growing plant cells, remains largely elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that the four core components shared by the two complexes, Vacuole protein sorting 11 (VPS11), VPS16, VPS33, and VPS18, are all essential for pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis thaliana and thus for plant reproduction success. We used VPS18 as a representative core component of the complexes to show that the protein is localized to both multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the tonoplast in a growing pollen tube. Mutant vps18 pollen tubes grew more slowly in vivo, resulting in a significant reduction in male transmission efficiency. Additional studies revealed that membrane fusion from MVBs to vacuoles is severely compromised in vps18 pollen tubes, corroborating the function of VPS18 in late endocytic trafficking. Furthermore, vps18 pollen tubes produce excessive exocytic vesicles at the apical zone and excessive amounts of pectin and pectin methylesterases in the cell wall. In conclusion, this study establishes an additional conserved role of HOPS/CORVET in homotypic membrane fusion during vacuole biogenesis in pollen tubes and reveals a feedback regulation of HOPS/CORVET in the secretion of cell wall modification enzymes of rapidly growing plant cells.",10.1093/plcell/koab164,34125904,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:18:11.188510-04:00,No,,

We analyzed 44,820 symptom reports logged by 2272 AirRater app users in Tasmania over four years (2015-2019). With these data we evaluated associations between daily respiratory symptoms and atmospheric pollen concentrations. We implemented Poisson regression models, using the case time series approach designed for app-sourced data. We assessed potentially non-linear and lagged associations with (a) total pollen and (b) six individual pollen taxa. We adjusted for seasonality and meteorology and tested for interactions with particulate air pollution (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). We found evidence of non-linear associations between total pollen and respiratory symptoms for up to three days following exposure.

Since Spain is the world's leading olive producer, and olive growing extends throughout the Mediterranean basin, this location is ideal for the study of long-distance transport events (LTD) during the main pollen season (MPS). The air masses were classified using the calculation of 48-h back trajectories at 250, 500 and 750 m above ground level using the HYSPLIT model. After that, the frequency of LDT events from Africa and Europe was found to be 8.7% of the MPS days. In contrast, regional air masses were found in 38.6% of the MPS days. This was reflected in pollen concentrations, with significantly higher concentrations (p-value &lt;0.05) on days with regional air masses compared to days with European air masses. Regarding the source areas, the importance of nearby sources with intense olive cultivation was confirmed (i.e., Andalusia). This proximity was relevant beyond the attenuations observed when the advections acquired a marine nature as the air mass back trajectories moved over the sea (p-value &lt;0.001). The review of air mass typologies, source areas and pollen concentrations resulted in establishing peak dates and the detection of LDT associated with these peak dates.

We analyzed the samples for anhydrosugars, primary sugars, and sugar alcohols using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The annual mean concentrations of total SCs ranged from 16.1 to 1748&#xa0;ng&#xa0;m<sup>-3</sup> (avg. 311&#xa0;ng&#xa0;m<sup>-3</sup>) with maxima in spring (avg. 484&#xa0;ng&#xa0;m<sup>-3</sup>) and minima in winter (avg. 28.2&#xa0;ng&#xa0;m<sup>-3</sup>). Primary sugars and sugar alcohols followed the seasonal pattern of total SCs. High levels of anhydrosugars in winter (avg. 22.9&#xa0;ng&#xa0;m<sup>-3</sup>) suggest a contribution of biomass burning from domestic heating due to lower ambient temperature. The high levels of arabitol and mannitol in spring followed by summer and autumn denote the contribution from multiple sources, i.e., growing vegetation and fungal spores in Sapporo forest. We observed an enhanced contribution of bioaerosols emitted from plant blossoms in spring and leaf decomposition in autumn. The identical seasonal trends of glucose and trehalose implied their similar sources in forest aerosols. Conversely, the highest concentration of sucrose in spring was due to the pollen emissions by blooming plants. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses of the SCs suggested that organic aerosols in the deciduous forest are associated with the emissions from multiple sources, including vegetation, microbes, pollens, and wintertime biomass burning. The PMF analysis also suggested that vegetation is the primary carbon source in the forest atmosphere. The diagnostic mass ratios of levoglucosan to mannosan demonstrated the dominance of softwood burning.

The search strategy included terms related to pollen, trends or measurements, and season timing. For inclusion, studies must have conducted a correlation analysis of at least 5 years of airborne pollen data to local meteorological data and report quantitative results. Data from peer-reviewed articles were extracted on the correlations between seven pollen indicators (main pollen season start date, end date, peak date, and length, annual pollen integral, average daily pollen concentration, and peak pollen concentration), and two meteorological variables (temperature and precipitation). Ninety-three articles were included in the analysis out of 9,679 articles screened. Overall, warmer temperatures correlated with earlier and longer pollen seasons and higher pollen concentrations. Precipitation had varying effects on pollen concentration and pollen season timing indicators. Increased precipitation may have a short-term effect causing low pollen concentrations potentially due to """"wash out"""" effect. Long-term effects of precipitation varied for trees and weeds and had a positive correlation with grass pollen levels.

We address this question by a synthesis and reanalysis of genetic data from more than 1,900 populations of 97 tree and shrub species around the world, using a newly developed framework for modeling long-term landscape connectivity by wind currents. We show that wind shapes three independent aspects of landscape genetics in plants with wind pollination or seed dispersal: populations linked by stronger winds are more genetically similar, populations linked by directionally imbalanced winds exhibit asymmetric gene flow ratios, and downwind populations have higher genetic diversity. For each of these distinct hypotheses, partial correlations between the respective wind and genetic metrics (controlling for distance and climate) are positive for a significant majority of wind-dispersed or wind-pollinated genetic data sets and increase significantly across functional groups expected to be increasingly influenced by wind. Together, these results indicate that the geography of both wind strength and wind direction play important roles in shaping large-scale genetic patterns across the world's forests.

Nectar-feeding birds often display behaviour that results in more pollen carryover than insect pollinators, which is predicted to result in frequent outcrossing and high paternal diversity for bird-pollinated plants. We tested this prediction by quantifying mating system parameters and bird visitation in three populations of an understory bird-pollinated herb, Anigozanthos humilis (Haemodoraceae). Microsatellite markers were used to genotype 131 adult plants, and 211 seeds from 23 maternal plants, from three populations. While outcrossing rates were high, estimates of paternal diversity were surprisingly low compared with other bird-pollinated plants. Despite nectar-feeding birds being common at the study sites, visits to A. humilis flowers were infrequent (62 visits over 21,552 recording hours from motion-triggered cameras, or equivalent to one visit per flower every 10&#xa0;days), and the majority (76%) were by a single species, the western spinebill Acanthorhynchus superciliosus (Meliphagidae). Pollen counts from 30 captured honeyeaters revealed that A. humilis comprised just 0.3% of the total pollen load. For 10 western spinebills, A. humilis pollen comprised only 4.1% of the pollen load, which equated to an average of 3.9 A. humilis pollen grains per bird. Taken together, our findings suggest that low visitation rates and low pollen loads of floral visitors have led to the low paternal diversity observed in this understory bird-pollinated herb. As such, we shed new light on the conditions that can lead to departures from high paternal diversity for plants competing for the pollination services of generalist nectar-feeding birds.",10.1007/s00442-021-04906-x,33870456,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 01:05:50.127183-04:00,No,,

However, few studies have focused on its reproductive biology. In this study, flow cytometric seed screening (FCSS) was used to identify and confirm the reproductive mode of the species. The development of ovules, anthers, and mega- and microgametophytes was observed using a clearing method and differential interference contrast microscopy. Pollen viability was measured using the Benzidine test and Alexander's stain. Pollen morphology was observed via fluorescence microscopy after sectioning the disk florets and staining with water-soluble aniline blue or 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclei dyes. Controlled pollination experiments were conducted on four populations in China to examine the breeding system and to confirm autonomous apomixis. The reproductive mode was found to be autonomous apomixis without pseudogamy, according to FCSS. Megaspore mother cells developed directly into eight-nucleate megagametophytes without meiosis, conforming to <i>Antennaria</i>-type diplospory. The unreduced egg cells developed into embryos through parthenogenesis, while the endosperm was formed by the fusion of two unreduced polar nuclei.

Herein, we evaluated the foraging patterns of the two species, concerning the potential pollen transfer between two blueberry co-blooming cultivars grown under open high tunnels during two seasons considering different colony densities. Both managed pollinators showed different foraging patterns, influenced by the cultivar identity which varied in their floral morphology and nectar production. Our results demonstrate that both species are efficient foragers on highbush blueberry and further suggest that they contribute positively to its pollination in complementary ways: while bumblebees were more effective at the individual level (visited more flowers and carried more pollen), the greater densities of honeybee foragers overcame the difficulties imposed by the flower morphology, irrespective of the stocking rate.

The impact of forest fragmentation seems to be modulated by the ecological amplitude and dispersal capacities of each species, resulting in different demographic histories. Moreover, while multiple studies investigated the western part of Central Africa (Lower Guinea), few have sufficiently sampled the heart of the Congo Basin (Congolia). In this study, we look for genetic discontinuities between populations of the widespread tropical tree Scorodophloeus zenkeri Harms (Fabaceae, Detarioideae) in Central Africa. Additionally, we characterize genetic diversity, selfing rate and fine-scale spatial genetic structure within populations to estimate the gene dispersal capacity of the species. Clear intraspecific genetic discontinuities occur throughout the species' distribution range, with two genetic clusters in Congolia and four in Lower Guinea, and highest differentiation occurring between these bioregions. Genetic diversity is higher in Lower Guinea than Congolia. A spatial genetic structure characteristic of isolation by distance occurs within the genetic clusters. This allowed us to estimate gene dispersal distances (&#x3c3;<sub>g</sub>) for this outcrossing species with ballistic seed dispersal, which range between 100 and 250&#xa0;m in areas where S. zenkeri occurs in high densities, and are in the low range of &#x3c3;<sub>g</sub> values compared to other tropical trees. Gene dispersal distances are larger in low density populations, probably due to extensive pollen dispersal capacity. Fragmentation of S. zenkeri populations seems to have occurred not only in Lower Guinea but also in the Congo Basin, though not necessarily according to previously postulated forest refuge areas. The lower genetic diversity in Congolia compared to Lower Guinea parallels the known gradient of species diversity, possibly reflecting a stronger impact of past climate changes on the forest cover in Congolia. Despite its bisexual flowers, S. zenkeri appears to be mostly outcrossing. The limited dispersal observed in this species implies that genetic discontinuities resulting from past forest fragmentation can persist for a long time before being erased by gene flow.",10.1186/s12862-021-01781-1,33784979,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:41:38.796061-04:00,No,,

Water deficit leads to increasing physiological stress in plants, likely affecting floral development and causing changes in floral morphology, nectar and pollen production or scent. Understanding how these floral traits are altered by water deficit is necessary to predict changes in plant-pollinator interactions and how communities are impacted in the future. Here we employ a meta-analysis approach to synthesize the current evidence of experimental water deficit on floral traits and plant-pollinator interactions. Furthermore, we explore experimental factors potentially increasing heterogeneity between studies and provide ideas how to enhance comparability between studies. In the end, we highlight future directions and knowledge gaps for floral traits and plant-pollinator interactions under water deficit. Our analysis showed consistent decreases in floral size, number of flowers and nectar volume to reduced water availability. Other floral traits such as the start of flowering or herkogamy showed no consistent pattern. This indicates that effects of reduced water availability differ between specific traits that are potentially involved in different functions such as pollinator attraction or efficiency. We found no general decreasing visitation rates with water deficit for flower-visitor interactions. Furthermore, the comparison of available studies suggests that increased reporting of plant stress severity and including more hydraulic and physiological measurements will improve the comparability across experiments and aid a more mechanistic understanding of plant-pollinator interactions under altered environmental conditions. Overall, our results show that water deficit has the potential to strongly affect plant-pollinator interactions via changes in specific floral traits. Linking these changes to pollination services and pollinator performance is one crucial step for understanding how changing water availability and drought events under climate change will alter plant and pollinator communities.",10.1111/gcb.15621,33774883,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:12:44.680918-04:00,No,,

No country yet provides clear guidance addressing these questions. We propose two previously unexplored approaches for forecasting the severity of the grass pollen season on the basis of statistical and mechanistic models. The results suggest annual severity is largely governed by preseasonal meteorological conditions.

Pb levels in ELF and nasal mucosa in Pb-exposed allergic mice were higher than those in Pb-exposed nonallergic mice, despite intranasally challenging the same amount of Pb. Because the increased Pb level in the nasal mucosa of Pb-exposed allergic mice was decreased after washing the nasal cavity, Pb on the surface of but not inside the nasal mucosa may have been a source of increased Pb level in ELF of allergic mice.

In case pesticide exposure to bees is likely, toxicity tests are performed with honey bees (Apis mellifera), with a tiered approach, for which validated and internationally accepted test protocols exist. However, concerns have grown regarding the protection of non-Apis bees [bumble bees (Bombus spp.), solitary and stingless bees], given their different life cycles and therefore distinct exposure routes. Larvae of solitary bees of the genus Osmia feed on unprocessed pollen during development, yet no toxicity test protocol is internationally accepted or validated to assess the impact of pesticide exposure during this stage of their life cycle. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to further validate a test protocol with two solitary bee species (O. cornuta and O. bicornis) to assess lethal and sublethal effects of pesticide exposure on larval development. Larvae were exposed to thiacloprid (neonicotinoid insecticide) mixed in a new, artificial pollen provision. Both lethal (developmental and winter mortality) and sublethal endpoints (larval development time, pollen provision consumption, cocoon weight, emergence time and adult longevity) were recorded. Effects of lower, more environmentally realistic doses were only reflected in sublethal endpoints. In both bee species, thiacloprid treatment was associated with increased developmental mortality and larval development time, and decreased pollen provision consumption and cocoon weight. The test protocol proved valid and robust and showed that for higher doses of thiacloprid the acute endpoint (larval mortality) is sufficient.

This study describes an automated end-to-end pipeline that combines deep learning and image processing approaches to extract tassel flowering patterns from time-lapse camera images of plants grown under field conditions. Inbred lines from the SAM and NAM diversity panels were grown at the Curtiss farm at Iowa State University, Ames, IA, during the summer of 2016. Using a set of around 500 pole-mounted cameras installed in the field, images of plants were captured every 10 minutes of daylight hours over a three-week period. Extracting data from imaging performed under field conditions is challenging due to variabilities in weather, illumination, and the morphological diversity of tassels. To address these issues, deep learning algorithms were used for tassel detection, classification, and segmentation. Image processing approaches were then used to crop the main spike of the tassel to track reproductive development. The results demonstrated that deep learning with well-labeled data is a powerful tool for detecting, classifying, and segmenting tassels. Our sequential workflow exhibited the following metrics: mAP for tassel detection was 0.91, F1 score obtained for tassel classification was 0.93, and accuracy of semantic segmentation in creating a binary image from the RGB tassel images was 0.95.

It is assumed that the causes of the increase of respiratory allergies are mainly related to environmental factors and lifestyle: first, the improvement of social and health conditions and related hygiene hypothesis; secondly, lifestyle change and anthropogenic activities, which have caused an alteration in the balance normally existing between soil, water, and atmosphere, giving rise to the phenomena of climate change. In fact, it has been demonstrated that they can influence beginning, duration, and intensity of the pollen season, as well as the allergenicity of pollen. The consequence is both an increase in frequency and intensity of allergic symptomatology in subjects previously affected by allergy, and a promotion of the sensitization of the airways to allergens present in the atmosphere in predisposed subjects. Several intervention strategies aiming to mitigate climate change and reduce anthropogenic emissions and, consequently, respiratory allergies are possible and can be implemented on an individual and social level.

Similarly, several studies of predominantly selfing species show variability in the level of residual outcrossing between populations and also between temporal samples of the same population. However, these studies measure global selfing rates at the scale of the population and we do not know whether there is intra-population variation and how outcrossing events are distributed, between genotypes, plants, flowers, or seeds. Theoretical studies predict the maintenance of residual outcrossing in highly selfing species due to environmental (e.g., pollen biology) and/or genetic determinants and decompositions of the variation in outcrossing rate using experimental data can be very informative to test these hypotheses. Here, we focus on one natural population of <i>M. truncatula</i> in order to describe precisely its mating system. In particular, we investigated the determinants of the selfing rate by testing for seasonal variations (environmental determinism) and variations between genotypes (genetic determinism). We measured selfing rates in maternal progenies from plants collected widely across a natural population. For each plant, we collected pods from flowers produced at the beginning and at the end of the flowering season to test for a seasonal variation in the outcrossing rate. For each collected offspring, we also estimated the likelihood that it was issued from a self-fertilization event and assessed the genetic component of variation of this mating system measure. We found a significant, albeit small, increase in outcrossing rate in progenies collected at the end [<i>t</i> <sub><i>m</i></sub> = 0.137 (<i>SD</i> = 0.025)] compared to those collected at the beginning [<i>t</i> <sub><i>m</i></sub> = 0.083 (0.016)] of the flowering season. A significant between genotypes variation in selfing rate was also detected, resulting in a heritability of 9% for the rate of residual outcrossing. Altogether, our work shows that despite a predominantly selfing reproductive mode, <i>M. truncatula</i> displays variation in residual outcrossing rate, and that this trait is likely under a complex determinism combining environmental and genetic factors.

As pollinators can detect small changes in trait expressions, drought-induced changes in floral traits could affect pollinator visitations. However, the linkage between changes in floral traits and pollinator visitations under drought conditions is not well explored. We, therefore, tested whether drought-induced changes in floral morphology and abundance of flowers are linked to changes in pollinator visitations. We conducted flight cage experiments with a radio frequency identification system for automated visitation recordings with bumble bees (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>) and common charlock (<i>Sinapis arvensis</i>) as the model system. In total, we recorded interactions for 31 foraging bumble bees and 6569 flower visitations. We found that decreasing soil moisture content correlated with decreasing size of all measured morphological traits except stamen length and nectar tube width. The reductions in floral size, petal width and length, nectar tube depth and number of flowers resulted in decreasing visitation rates by bumble bees. These decreasing visitations under lower soil moisture availability might be explained by lower numbers of flowers and thus a reduced attractiveness and/or by increased difficulties experienced by bumble bees in handling smaller flowers. Whether these effects act additively or synergistically on pollinator behaviour and whether this leads to changes in pollen transfer and to different selectionp ressures require further investigation.",10.1093/aobpla/plab001,33628409,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:07:07.340457-04:00,No,,

Based on long-term phenological flowering and airborne pollen data (1987-2017) for six stations and seven taxa across Bavaria, Germany, we studied changes in the pollen season, compared pollen and flowering season start dates to determine pollen sources, and analyzed the likelihood of pollen transport by HYSPLIT back trajectories. Species advanced their pollen season more in early spring (e.g., <i>Corylus</i> and <i>Alnus</i> by up to 2 days yr<sup>-1</sup>) than in mid spring (<i>Betula, Fraxinus, Pinus</i>); <i>Poaceae</i> and <i>Artemisia</i> exhibited mixed trends in summer. Annual pollen sums mainly increased for <i>Corylus</i> and decreased for <i>Poaceae</i> and <i>Artemisia</i>. Start of pollen season trends largely deviated from flowering trends, especially for <i>Corylus</i> and <i>Alnus</i>. Transport phenomena, which rely on comparisons between flowering and pollen dates, were determined for 2005-2015 at three stations. Pre-season pollen was a common phenomenon: airborne pollen was predominantly observed earlier than flowering (median 17 days) and in general, in 63% of the cases (except for <i>Artemisia</i> and <i>Poaceae</i>, and the alpine location) the pollen sources were non-local (transported). In 54% (35%) of these cases, back trajectories confirmed (partly confirmed) the pre-season transport, only in 11% of the cases transport modeling failed to explain the records. Even within the main pollen season, 70% of pollen season start dates were linked to transport. At the alpine station, non-local pollen sources (both from outside Bavaria as well as Bavarian lowlands) predominated, in only 13% of these cases transport could not be confirmed by back trajectories. This prominent role of pollen transport has important implications for the length, the timing, and the severity of the allergenic pollen season, indicating only a weak dependency on flowering of local pollen sources.",10.3389/falgy.2021.627863,35386987,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:17:54.136139-04:00,No,,

While most studies have focused on the genetic factors affecting male sterility, the dynamic gene expression patterns of pollen abortion in male sterile lines have not been fully elucidated. In addition, there is still no hybrid oat that is commercially planted due to the lack of a suitable system of male sterility for hybrid breeding. In this study, we cultivated a male sterile oat line and a near-isogenic line by crossbreeding to elucidate the expression patterns of genes that may be involved in sterility. The first reported CA male sterile (CAMS) oat line was used for cross-testing and hybridization experiments and was confirmed to exhibit a type of nuclear sterility controlled by recessive genes. Oat stamens of two lines were sampled at four different developmental stages separately. Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed for each sample and generated 252.84 Gb sequences.

Here we investigated sex-specific differences in selection of sexually dimorphic traits and in the spatial distribution of effective fecundity (our fitness proxy) in a highly dimorphic dioecious wind-pollinated shrub, Leucadendron rubrum. In particular, we tested for the effect of density on male and female effective fecundity. We used spatial and genotypic data of parent and offspring cohorts to jointly estimate individual male and female effective fecundity on the one hand and pollen and seed dispersal kernels on the other hand. This methodology was adapted to the case of dioecious species. Explicitly modelling dispersal avoids the confounding effects of heterogeneous spatial distribution of mates and sampled seedlings on the estimation of effective fecundity. We also estimated selection gradients on plant traits while modelling sex-specific spatial autocorrelation in fecundity. Males exhibited spatial autocorrelation in effective fecundity at a smaller scale than females. A higher local density of plants was associated with lower effective fecundity in males but was not related to female effective fecundity. These results suggest sex-specific sensitivities to environmental heterogeneity in L.&#xa0;rubrum. Despite these sexual differences, we found directional selection for wider canopies and smaller leaves in both sexes, and no sexually antagonistic selection on strongly dimorphic traits in L.&#xa0;rubrum.

These floral traits differ tremendously between species, but intraspecific differences and their consequences on organism interactions remain largely unknown. Floral volatile compounds, such as terpenoids, function as cues to advertise rewards to pollinators, but should at the same time also repel florivores. The reward composition, e.g., protein and lipid contents in pollen, differs between individuals of distinct plant families. Whether the nutritional value of rewards within the same plant species is linked to their chemotypes, which differ in their pattern of specialized metabolites, has yet not been investigated. In the present study, we compared <i>Tanacetum vulgare</i> plants of five terpenoid chemotypes with regard to flower production, floral headspace volatiles, pollen macronutrient and terpenoid content, and floral attractiveness to florivorous beetles. Our analyses revealed remarkable differences between the chemotypes in the amount and diameter of flower heads, duration of bloom period, and pollen nutritional quality. The floral headspace composition of pollen-producing mature flowers, but not of premature flowers, was correlated to that of pollen and leaves in the same plant individual. For two chemotypes, florivorous beetles discriminated between the scent of mature and premature flower heads and preferred the latter. In semi-field experiments, the abundance of florivorous beetles and flower tissue miners differed between <i>T. vulgare</i> chemotypes. Moreover, the scent environment affected the choice and beetles were more abundant in homogenous plots composed of one single chemotype than in plots with different neighboring chemotypes. In conclusion, flower production, floral metabolic composition and pollen quality varied to a remarkable extend within the species <i>T. vulgare</i>, and the attractiveness of floral scent differed also intra-individually with floral ontogeny. We found evidence for a trade-off between pollen lipid content and pollen amount on a per-plant-level.

Among the strategies that are attracting attention in the protection of crops from abiotic stresses, there is the use of plant biostimulants. In this study, Megafol (Meg), a commercial plant biostimulant, was tested on olive plants subjected to severe saline stress. Plants treated with salt alone showed substantial reductions in biomass production, leaf net photosynthesis (Pn), leaf transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (gs), and relative water content (RWC). In addition, samples stressed with NaCl showed a higher sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) content in the leaves, while those stressed with NaCl and biostimulated with Meg increased the potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) content in the leaves, thus showing a higher K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio. Salinity caused the accumulation of significant quantities of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and malondialdehyde (MDA) due to decreases in the activity of antioxidant enzymes, namely superoxide dismutase (SOD - EC 1.15.1.1), ascorbate peroxidase (APX - EC 1.11.1.11), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX - EC 1.11.1.9), and catalase (CAT - EC 1.11.1.6).

The sperm cells fertilize the egg cell and the central cell in a one-to-one manner to yield a zygote and an endosperm, respectively. The one-to-one distribution of the sperm cells to the two female gametes is strictly regulated, possibly via communication among the four gametes. Polyspermy block is the mechanism by which fertilized female gametes prevent fertilization by a secondary sperm cell, and has been suggested to operate in the egg cell rather than the central cell. However, whether the central cell also has the ability to avoid polyspermy during double fertilization remains unclear. Here, we assessed the one-to-one fertilization mechanism of the central cell by laser irradiation of the female gametes and live cell imaging of the fertilization process in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We successfully disrupted an egg cell within the ovules by irradiation using a femtosecond pulse laser. In the egg-disrupted ovules, the central cell predominantly showed single fertilization by one sperm cell, suggesting that neither the egg cell nor its fusion with one sperm cell is necessary for one-to-one fertilization (i.e., monospermy) of the central cell. In addition, using <i>tetraspore</i> mutants possessing multiple sperm cell pairs in one pollen, we demonstrated that normal double fertilization was observed even when excess sperm cells were released into the receptive region between the female gametes. In ovules accepting four sperm cells, the egg cell never fused with more than one sperm cell, whereas half of the central cells fused with more than one sperm cell (i.e., polyspermy) even 1 h later. Our results suggest that the central cell can block polyspermy during double fertilization, although the central cell is more permissive to polyspermy than the egg cell. The potential contribution of polyspermy block by the central cell is discussed in terms of how it is involved in the one-to-one distribution of the sperm cells to two distinct female gametes.",10.3389/fpls.2020.588700,33510743,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:19:51.670913-04:00,No,,

There have been some murine models for Humulus pollen allergy established by intraperitoneal (IP) sensitization and nasal drip stimulation, but they were not comprehensive enough. Here, we used atomized inhalation for challenge and compared the subcutaneous (SC) and IP sensitization routes to determine the optimal method to establish a model of asthma induced by Humulus pollen. Subsequently, we tried to develop a rapid subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) model for Humulus allergy. BALB/c Mice were sensitized through the SC or IP route, with respective reference to previously established sensitization methods and allergen dosing, and challenged with nebulized Humulus pollen extract to induce asthma. To compare the two sensitization methods, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), inflammatory cell infiltration, allergen-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E (sIgE) levels, cytokine levels, and lung histopathology were assessed. The effects of SCIT (once every other day for 16 days) on airway inflammation, AHR, sIgE, and allergen-specific serum IgG2a (sIgG2a) levels were evaluated by using the model established in this study. Although mice sensitized by the SC or IP routes both showed AHR and airway inflammation, the SC route elicited significantly higher levels of sIgE, eosinophil inflammation, and T helper type 2 cytokines, compared with the IP route. SCIT in the treatment group significantly reduced the titers of sIgE, enhanced the titers of sIgG2a, and effectively alleviated pulmonary inflammation and AHR, compared with the vehicle group. The SC route can be used to establish a murine model of Humulus pollen allergy that recapitulates the characteristics of clinical allergic asthma.

In rice, multiple transcription factors and enzymes essential for tapetum development and pollen wall formation have been cloned from male-sterile lines. In this study, we obtained several lines in which the MYB transcription factor OsMS188 was knocked out through the CRISPR-Cas9 approach. The osms188 lines exhibited a male-sterile phenotype with aberrant development and degeneration of tapetal cells, absence of the sexine layer and defective anther cuticles. CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice. Plants with mutations in these genes are male sterile, with a defective sexine layer and anther cuticle. Further biochemical assays demonstrated that OsMS188 binds directly to the promoters of these genes to regulate their expression. UDT1, OsTDF1, TDR, bHLH142 and EAT1 are upstream regulators of rice tapetum development. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and activation assays revealed that TDR directly regulates OsMS188 expression. Additionally, protein interaction assays indicated that TDR interacts with OsMS188 to regulate downstream gene expression.

The receptor population contains two locations that provide different expected offspring numbers to invaders. There is demographic stochasticity in offspring numbers. In addition, temporal variation causes local invader fitnesses to vary. We show that effects of environmental autocorrelation on establishment success depend on spatial covariance of the receptor subpopulations. In situations with a low spatial covariance this effect is positive, whereas high spatial covariance and/or high migration probabilities between the subpopulations causes the effect to be negative. This result reconciles seemingly contradictory results from the literature concerning effects of temporal variation on population dynamics with demographic stochasticity.

After the publication of the work of Noon and Freeman in 1911, the practice of AIT spread rapidly and was applied to many other pollen allergens besides grass and for perennial rhinitis and asthma. The early studies were largely anecdotal, but over the past 60 to 70 years, studies of AIT have been conducted with increasingly sophisticated scientific methods. Nowadays, not only is the practice of AIT based on carefully conducted studies, but the underlying immunologic basis of allergy and the response to AIT have also been and still are being firmly established.

The clinical part (an anamnesis, physical examination, spirometry, skin prick tests and an assay of major airborne allergen-specific IgE) was attended by 25.7% of the respondents. The AR was most strongly related to sensitisation to <i>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</i>, with the highest odds ratios of 10 in two younger groups and of 16 for persistent AR in children. It was also the most important risk factor for allergic asthma, with odd ratios from 8.34 in children to 6.40 in adolescents. Sensitisation to grass pollen allergens was a major risk factor for both AR, with odds ratios from 9.16 in adults to 7.87 in adolescents, and asthma, with odds ratios from 6.16 in adolescents to 5.67 in adults. AR and asthma shared common risk factors, independently of age. Sensitisation to airborne allergens was significantly associated with asthma and, even more strongly, with AR, across all age groups. The AR was the strongest risk factor for allergic asthma in the youngest group.

Increased atmospheric temperatures lead to earlier pollination of many plants and longer duration of pollination, resulting in extended pollen seasons, with early spring or late winter. Longer pollen seasons increase duration of exposure, resulting in more sensitization, and higher pollen concentrations may lead to more severe symptoms.

Salinity, in particular, is a major problem for crop yield known to affect about 20% of all arable land and cause huge economic losses worldwide. Flowering plants are particularly sensitive to environmental stress during sexual reproduction, and even a short exposure to stressing conditions can severely hamper reproductive success, and thus reduce crop yield. Since proline is required for pollen fertility and accumulates in plant tissues in response to different abiotic stresses, a role of proline in pollen protection under salt stress conditions can be envisaged. In this perspective, we analyze old and new data to evaluate the importance of pollen development under saline conditions, and discuss the possibility of raising proline levels in pollen grains as a biotechnological strategy to stabilize seed yield in the presence of salt stress. The overall data confirm that proline is necessary to preserve pollen fertility and limit seed loss under stressful conditions.

Climate change is already affecting the abundance and distribution of insects, which could cause geographical mismatches between crops and their pollinators. Crops that rely primarily on wild pollinators (e.g., crops that cannot be effectively pollinated by commercial colonies of honey bees) could be particularly in jeopardy. However, limited information on plant-pollinator associations and pollinator distributions complicate the assessment of climate change impacts on specific crops. To study the potential impacts of climate change on pollination of a specific crop in North America, we use the case of open-field tomato crops, which rely on buzz pollinators (species that use vibration to release pollen, such as bumble bees) to increase their production. We aimed to (1) assess potential changes in buzz pollinator distribution and richness, and (2) evaluate the overlap between areas with high densities of tomato crops and high potential decrease in richness. We used baseline (1961-1990) climate and future (2050s and 2080s) climatic projections in ecological niche models fitted with occurrences of wild bees, documented in the literature as pollinators of tomatoes, to estimate the baseline and future potential distribution of suitable climatic conditions of targeted species and to create maps of richness change across North America. We obtained reliable models for 15 species and found important potential decreases in the distribution of some pollinators (e.g., Lasioglossum pectorale and Augochlorella aurata). We observed geographical discrepancies in the projected change in species richness across North America, detecting important declines in the eastern United States (up to 11 species decrease for 2050s). After overlapping the maps of species richness change with a tomato crop map for the United States, we found spatial correspondence between richness declines and areas with high concentration of tomato crops. Disparities in the effects of climate change on the potential future distribution of different wild pollinators and geographical variation in richness highlight the importance of crop-specific studies. Our study also emphasizes the challenges of compiling and modeling crop-specific pollinator data and the need to improve our understanding of current distribution of pollinators and their community dynamics under climate change.",10.1002/eap.2259,33179379,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:30:08.626729-04:00,No,,

In this study, we propose the state-of-the-art WRF-Chem model, which is a complex Eulerian meteorological model integrated on-line with atmospheric chemistry. We used a combination of the WRF-Chem extended towards birch pollen, and the emission module based on heating degree days, which has not been tested before. The simulations were run for the moderate season in terms of birch pollen concentrations (year 2015) and high season (year 2016) over Central Europe, which were validated against 11 observational stations located in Poland. The results show that there is a big difference in the model's performance for the two modelled years. In general, the model overestimates birch pollen concentrations for the moderate season and highly underestimates birch pollen concentrations for the year 2016. The model was able to predict birch pollen concentrations for first allergy symptoms (above 20 pollen&#xa0;m<sup>-3</sup>) as well as for severe symptoms (above 90 pollen&#xa0;m<sup>-3</sup>) with probability of detection at 0.78 and 0.68 and success ratio at 0.75 and 0.57, respectively for the year 2015. However, the model failed to reproduce these parameters for the year 2016. The results indicate the potential role of correcting the total seasonal pollen emission in improving the model's performance, especially for specific years in terms of pollen productivity.

Our hypothesis is that distinct physical processes, phase separation and micellar self-assembly, underpinexine development by taking the molecular building blocks, determined and synthesised by the genome, through several phase transitions. To test this hypothesis, we traced each stage of microspore development in Calycanthus floridus with transmission electron microscopy and then generated in&#xa0;vitro experimental simulations corresponding to every developmental stage. The sequence of structures observed within the periplasmic space around developing microspores starts with spherical units, which are rearranged into columns to then form rod-like units (the young columellae) and, finally, white line centred endexine lamellae. Phase separation precedes each developmental stage. The set of experimental simulations, obtained as self-assembled micellar mesophases formed at the interface between lipid and water compartments, was the same: spherical micelles; columns of spherical micelles; cylindrical micelles; and laminate micelles, separated by gaps, resembling white-lined lamellae. Thus, patterns simulating structures observed at the main stages of exine development in C.&#xa0;floridus were obtained from in&#xa0;vitro experiments, and hence purely physicochemical processes can construct exine-like patterns. This highlights the important part played by physical processes that are not under direct genomic control and share influence on the emerging ultrastructure with the genome during exine development.

Given the high rate of seed abortion (one of the reasons being the failure of ovule and pollen development) in C. lanceolata, the proper formation of female/male cones could theoretically increase the number of offspring in future generations. MIKC MADS-box genes are well-known for their roles in the flower/cone development and comprise the typical/atypical floral development model for both angiosperms and gymnosperms. We performed a transcriptomic analysis to find genes differentially expressed between female and male cones at a single, carefully determined developmental stage, focusing on the MIKC MADS-box genes. We finally obtained 47 unique MIKC MADS-box genes from C. lanceolata and divided these genes into separate branches. 27 out of the 47 MIKC MADS-box genes showed differential expression between female and male cones, and most of them were not expressed in leaves. Out of these 27 genes, most B-class genes (AP3/PI) were up-regulated in the male cone, while TM8 genes were up-regulated in the female cone. Then, with no obvious overall preference for AG (class C&#x2009;+&#x2009;D) genes in female/male cones, it seems likely that these genes are involved in the development of both cones.

Our study identified a number of MIKC MADS-box genes showing differential expression between female and male cones in C. lanceolata, illustrating a potential link of these genes with C. lanceolata cone development. On the basis of this, we postulated a possible cone development model for C. lanceolata.

Mite numbers also can sharply rise, particularly in the fall, by the migration of varroa into hives on foragers. Colonies with high levels of varroa and viruses often die over the winter. Feeding colonies pollen might keep virus levels low and improve survival because of the positive effects of pollen on immunity and colony growth. We compared varroa and virus levels and overwinter survival in colonies with (fed) and without (unfed) supplemental pollen.

The growth of varroa populations was correlated with FWM in fed and unfed colonies, and significantly affected DWV levels.

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between wing morphological variation and metabolic performance, flight aerodynamics and energetic reserves in females and males of Heliconius charithonia over two years. The results confirm the presence of wing shape sexual dimorphism, but also show an unexpected sex-related annual variation in wing shape, mirrored in the metabolic condition (resting metabolic rate) of individuals. However, contrary to expectation, intersexual variations in wing shape are not related to differences between the sexes in terms of flight aerodynamics, flight metabolic rates, or energetic reserves (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins).

In this study, culture-independent and dependent methods were used to examine the presence and diversity of oxygenic photoautotrophic microbes in clouds and rain collected at or around puy de D&#xf4;me Mountain, central France. Cloud water was collected from the summit of puy de D&#xf4;me (1,465 m above sea level [a.s.l.]) for cultivation and metagenomic analysis. Cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, and other oxygenic photoautotrophs were found to be recurrent members of clouds, while green algae affiliated with the Chlorellaceae were successfully cultured from three different clouds. Additionally, rain samples were collected below the mountain from Opme meteorological station (680 m a.s.l.). The abundance of chlorophyll <i>a</i>-containing cells and the diversity of cyanobacteria and green algae in rain were assessed by flow cytometry and amplicon sequencing. The corresponding downward flux of chlorophyll <i>a</i>-containing organisms to the ground, entering surface ecosystems with rain, varied with time and was estimated to be between &#x223c;1 and &gt;300 cells cm<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> during the sampling period.

Here, we assess feasibility of middle-up/middle-down analysis for polyclonal IgGs exhibiting extensive sequence variability. Specifically, we addressed IgGs from mouse, representing an important model system in immunological investigations. To obtain Fc/2 portions as conserved subunits of IgGs, we made use of the bacterial protease SpeB. For this purpose, we initially determined SpeB cleavage sites in murine IgGs. The resulting Fc/2 portions characteristic of different subclasses were subsequently analysed by ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC hyphenated to high-resolution mass spectrometry. This enabled simultaneous relative quantification of IgG subclasses and their N-glycosylation variants, both of which influence IgG effector functions. To assess method capabilities in an immunological context, we applied the analytical workflow to polyclonal antibodies obtained from BALB/c mice immunized with the grass pollen allergen Phl p 6. The study revealed a shift in IgG subclasses and Fc-glycosylation patterns in total and antigen-specific IgGs from different mouse cohorts, respectively.

We investigated the impact of water stress on two pseudocereal species, common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) and Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum). Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions under two water regimes: control (40-50% soil humidity) and water stress (&lt;20% soil humidity). Although closely related, both species differed by their resistance to water stress. The vegetative growth was affected in F. esculentum but not in F. tataricum as water stress decreased leaf production, leaf fresh, and dry weight, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and photosynthesis rate in the former but not in the latter. However, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were not affected by water stress, whatever the species, and the chlorophyll content increased in water-stressed plants in both species. Oxidative stress was observed in both species in response to water stress, and antioxidant content was increased in F. tataricum. The reproductive phase was affected by water stress in both species: the number of inflorescences and pollen production decreased, mainly in F. esculentum. Seed set was maintained in F. tataricum while this parameter was not investigated in F. esculentum due to its self-incompatibility. Our results suggested that F. tataricum was more resistant to water stress than F. esculentum and that F. esculentum had characteristics of drought avoidance, while F. tataricum exhibited traits of drought tolerance.",10.1111/ppl.13248,33090466,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:12:47.239589-04:00,No,,

Some of these can be deleterious to agricultural crops and forest trees, such as the bacterium <i>Pantoea</i> <i>ananatis</i>, an emerging pathogen in some systems. <i>P.</i> <i>ananatis</i> infections can lead to leaf blotches, die-back, bulb rot, and fruit rot. 2.

Honeybees decreased their responsiveness to different sugar solutions when these contained high concentrations of <i>P. ananatis</i> but were not deterred by solutions from which bacteria had been removed. This suggests that their reduced responsiveness was due to the taste of bacteria and not to the depletion of sugar in the solution or bacteria metabolites. Intriguingly, the bees appeared not to taste ecologically relevant low concentrations of bacteria. 4. <i>Synthesis and applications.</i> Our data suggest that honeybees may introduce <i>P.</i> <i>ananatis</i> bacteria into nectar in field-realistic densities during foraging trips and may thus affect nectar quality and plant fitness.",10.3390/insects11100692,33053745,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:10:04.323758-04:00,No,,

The Early Ahmarian techno-cultural unit covers a time range between 45 ka-37 ka BP. With so far more than 50 sites found, the Early Ahmarian is the first fully Upper Palaeolithic techno-cultural unit exclusively and undisputedly related to anatomically modern human populations. In order to better understand the potentially attractive features of the Early Ahmarian environmental context that supported its persistence for over 8,000 years, we carried out a decennial research program in Jordan and in the Dead Sea. This included (1) a geoscientific and archaeological survey program in the Wadi Sabra (Jordan) with a particular focus on excavations at the Early Ahmarian site of Al-Ansab 1 alongside the detailed analysis of Quaternary sediments from the same area and (2) palaeobotanical research based on Quaternary lake deposits from the Dead Sea. Our pollen data from the Dead Sea indicate slow, low frequency vegetational variation with expanding Artemisia steppe, from 60 to 20 ka BP (MIS 3-2). Here, we see a reciprocal assimilation of southern and northern Levantine vegetation zones thereby enhancing a long-lasting south-to-north steppe corridor. The same integration process accelerated about 40 ka ago, when forested areas retreated in the Lebanese Mountains. The process then extended to encompass an area from Southern Lebanon to the Sinai Peninsula. We argue that, at the same time, the carriers of the Early Ahmarian techno-cultural unit extended their habitat from their original Mediterranean biome (in the North) to the Saharo-Arabian biome (to the South). Our excavation of Al-Ansab 1, a campsite at the eastern margins of the Early Ahmarian settlement area, indicates far reaching annual movements of small, highly mobile hunter-gatherer groups. We assume a low degree of settlement complexity, still allowing for habitat extension of the Early Ahmarian into the margins of the Levantine corridor. Due to our radiometric dates, our combined archaeological and environmental record sheds light on an evolved phase of the Early Ahmarian, around 38 ka ago, rather than the starting phase of this techno-cultural unit. Possible application of our model to the starting phase of the Early Ahmarian remains an aspect of future research.""",10.1371/journal.pone.0239968,33048958,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 00:53:51.526884-04:00,No,,

To protect themselves until rehydration, the grains undergo characteristic infolding with the help of special structures in the grain wall-apertures-where the otherwise thick exine shell is absent or reduced in thickness. Recent theoretical studies have highlighted the importance of apertures for the elastic response and the folding of the grain. Experimental observations show that different pollen grains sharing the same number and type of apertures can nonetheless fold in quite diverse fashions. Using the thin-shell theory of elasticity, we show how both the absolute elastic properties of the pollen wall and the relative elastic differences between the exine wall and the apertures play an important role in determining pollen folding upon desiccation. Focusing primarily on colpate pollen, we delineate the regions of pollen elastic parameters where desiccation leads to a regular, complete closing of all apertures and thus to an infolding which protects the grain against water loss. Phase diagrams of pollen folding pathways indicate that an increase in the number of apertures leads to a reduction of the region of elastic parameters where the apertures close in a regular fashion. The infolding also depends on the details of the aperture shape and size, and our study explains how the features of the mechanical design of apertures influence the pollen folding patterns. Understanding the mechanical principles behind pollen folding pathways should also prove useful for the design of the elastic response of artificial inhomogeneous shells.",10.1073/pnas.2011084117,33028678,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:27:57.196616-04:00,No,,

Gynodioecy is a sexually dimorphic breeding system in which females (F, male sterile) and hermaphrodites (H) coexist in the same population. For plants with nuclear (biparental) inheritance of male sterility, theory predicts that except when the product of selfing rate (s) and inbreeding depression (&#x3b4;) in H is high (s&#x3b4;&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.50), F must compensate (female advantage) for the loss of gene transmission via pollen production by producing more or higher-quality offspring than H to be maintained in the population. For species with cytoplasmic (maternal) inheritance of male sterility, the female requires only a small compensation in seed production or some other offspring fitness trait to persist. Reallocation to seeds of resources saved by loss of pollen production is expected to increase the quantity (number) and/or quality (mass, germinability) of seeds produced by F, thus compensating for the lack of pollen production. The primary aim of our study was to compare seed germination of F and H via a literature review.

Higher flowering synchrony yielded greater pollination efficiency, which resulted in 2-fold greater seed set in highly synchronised oaks compared to asynchronous individuals. Pollen addition removed the negative effect of asynchronous flowering on seed set. Because phenological synchrony operates through environmental variation, this result suggests that oak masting is synchronised by exogenous rather than endogenous factors.

Japanese cedar trees have been selected for growth speed and superior morphological traits and then cloned. These clones may vary in their pollen production, but there has been little research on how many pollen grains are produced by a single male strobilus (flower). A recently reported method for counting pollen number with a cell counter was applicable to <i>Arabidopsis</i> species and wheat, but was not suitable for Japanese cedar because the strobilus does not open with heating (e.g. 60&#xa0;&#xb0;C, overnight).

This paper reports on the effects of field margin component typology (ditches, grass strips, shrubs, trees, and vehicle tracks) and complexity (the number of components), on the herbaceous vegetation of field margins. Forty field margins were sampled in 2016 in a 200 ha. organic mixed arable livestock farm. The factor which was identified as having the most effect on vegetation composition was adjacent land-use type, which reflected the margins' management regime. However, field margin components were found to affect vegetation response and effect traits. Tree components had less grassweeds than vehicle tracks while more complex field margins also had less grassweeds than simple field margins near cropped fields, most likely due to the lower availability in light and less disturbance from vehicles. Simple grassy margins produced a high proportion of hymenoptera flowers. These results highlight the importance of field margin components in maintaining a high diversity of vegetation typologies differing in effect traits that are relevant for the provisioning of ecosystem services, such as supporting pollen and nectar requirements of beneficial insects, as well as their importance in determining the presence of weed species that could potentially invade the cropped fields.",10.1371/journal.pone.0238916,32941477,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:30:13.907908-04:00,No,,

However, carrion- or faeces-mimicking is rarely described for such plants. There is no information on the pollination biology of Cynomoriaceae, despite the fact that these plants are rare and vulnerable. This is the first study to reveal pollination in a member of this family, Cynomorium songaricum, a root holoparasite with a distinctive and putrid floral odour. From 2016 to 2018, we studied the floral volatiles, floral visitors and pollinators, behavioural responses of visitors to floral volatiles, breeding system, flowering phenology and floral biology of two wild populations of C. songaricum in Alxa, Inner Mongolia, China. A total of 42 volatiles were identified in inflorescences of C. songaricum. Among these volatiles are compounds known as typical carrion scents, such as p-cresol, indole, dimethyl disulphide and 1-octen-3-ol. C. songaricum is pollinated by various Diptera, such as Musca domestica, M. stabulans (Muscidae), Delia setigera, D. platura (Anthomyiidae), Lucilia sericata, L. caesar (Calliphoridae), Wohlfahrtia indigens, Sarcophaga noverca, S. crassipalpis and Sarcophila meridionalis (Sarcophagidae). The inflorescence scent of C. songaricum attracted these pollinators. The plants significantly benefit from insect pollination, although wind can be a pollen vector in the absence of pollinators. C. songaricum is a cross-pollinated, self-incompatible plant. Our findings suggest that C. songaricum releases malodorous volatiles to attract Diptera to achieve pollination. This new example lays the foundation for further comparative studies in other members of this plant group and contributes to a better understanding of fly-pollinated, carrion mimicking plants.",10.1111/plb.13180,32915486,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:19:46.691029-04:00,No,,

Such shifts are likely accentuated in the rapidly warming Arctic. Targeting a plant community in Northeast Greenland, we asked (a) whether the relative phenology of plants is shifting with spatial variation in temperature, (b) whether local plants compete for pollination, and (c) whether shifts in climatic conditions are likely to affect this competition. We first searched for climatic imprints on relative species phenology along an elevational gradient. We then tested for signs of competition with increasing flower densities: reduced pollinator visits, reduced representation of plant species in pollen loads, and reduced seed production. Finally, we evaluated how climate change may affect this competition. Compared to a dominant species, Dryas integrifolia&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;octopetala, the relative timing of other species shifted along the environmental gradient, with Silene acaulis and Papaver radicatum flowering earlier toward higher elevation. This shift resulted in larger niche overlap, allowing for an increased potential for competition for pollination. Meanwhile, Dryas emerged as a superior competitor by attracting 97.2% of flower visits. Higher Dryas density resulted in reduced insect visits and less pollen of S. acaulis being carried by pollinators, causing reduced seed set by S. acaulis. Our results show that current variation in climate shifts the timing and flowering overlap between dominant and less-competitive plant species. With climate warming, such shifts in phenology within trophic levels may ultimately affect interactions between them, changing the strength of competition among plants.",10.1111/gcb.15303,32914477,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:49:22.001887-04:00,No,,

This study aimed to characterize the main components of SCBPE and investigate its protective effects against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced H9c2 cardiomyocyte injury. The main components of SCBPE were analyzed via ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF MS/MS). The three main nucleosides in SCBPE were quantitatively analyzed via ultraperformance liquid chromatography-diode array detection. Furthermore, the potential mechanism by which SCBPE exerts protective effects against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced H9c2 cardiomyocyte injury was explored for the first time via cell survival rate measurements; cell morphological observation; myocardial superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) level determination; flow cytometry; and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Two carbohydrates, three nucleosides, and nine quinic acid nitrogen-containing derivatives in SCBPE were identified or tentatively characterized via UPLC-QTOF MS/MS.

Many hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), including Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), extensins (EXTs), and proline-rich proteins (PRPs), are identified as HCPs by bioinformatics approaches. The experimental evidence for validation of novel proline hydroxylation sites is vital for understanding their functional roles. In this study, the 62 HCPs containing 114 hydroxyproline (O, Hyp) residues were identified, and it was found that hydroxylation of proline residues in the HCPs could either constitute attachment sites for glycans or have other biological function in rice. The glycomodules of AO, OA, OG, VO, LO, and OE were abundant in the 62 HCPs. Further analysis showed that the 22 of 62 HCPs contained both signal peptides and transmembrane domains, and the 19 HCPs only contained transmembrane domains, while 21 HCPs contained neither. This study indicated the feasibility of mass spectrometry-based proteomics combined with bioinformatics approaches for the large-scale characterization of Hyp sites from complex protein digest mixtures. Furthermore, the expression of AGPs in rice was detected by using &#x3b2;-GlcY reagent and JIM13 antibody. The results displayed that the AGPs were widely distributed in different tissues and organs of rice, especially expressed highly in lateral root, pollen and embryo.

Flying-foxes (Pteropus spp.) are large bats that forage by night on floral resources and rest by day in arboreal roosts that may contain colonies of many thousands of individuals. They are the largest mammals capable of powered flight, and are highly mobile, which makes them key seed and pollen dispersers in forest ecosystems. However, their mobility also facilitates transmission of zoonotic diseases and brings them in conflict with humans, and so they require a precarious balancing of conservation and management concerns throughout their Old World range. Here, we analyze the Australia-wide movements of 201 satellite-tracked individuals, providing unprecedented detail on the inter-roost movements of three flying-fox species: Pteropus alecto, P. poliocephalus, and P. scapulatus across jurisdictions over up to 5&#xa0;years. Individuals were estimated to travel long distances annually among a network of 755 roosts (P. alecto, 1427-1887&#x2009;km; P. poliocephalus, 2268-2564&#x2009;km; and P. scapulatus, 3782-6073&#x2009;km), but with little uniformity among their directions of travel. This indicates that flying-fox populations are composed of extremely mobile individuals that move nomadically and at species-specific rates. Individuals of all three species exhibited very low fidelity to roosts locally, resulting in very high estimated daily colony turnover rates (P. alecto, 11.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.3%; P. poliocephalus, 17.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.3%; and P. scapulatus, 36.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.5%). This indicates that flying-fox roosts form nodes in a vast continental network of highly dynamic """"staging posts"""" through which extremely mobile individuals travel far and wide across their species ranges. The extreme inter-roost mobility reported here demonstrates the extent of the ecological linkages that nomadic flying-foxes provide across Australia's contemporary fragmented landscape, with profound implications for the ecosystem services and zoonotic dynamics of flying-fox populations. In addition, the extreme mobility means that impacts from local management actions can readily reverberate across jurisdictions throughout the species ranges; therefore, local management actions need to be assessed with reference to actions elsewhere and hence require national coordination. These findings underscore the need for sound understanding of animal movement dynamics to support evidence-based, transboundary conservation and management policy, tailored to the unique movement ecologies of species.""",10.1186/s12915-020-00829-w,32819385,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:48:32.562327-04:00,No,,

In total, 113 wheat PG genes were identified, which could be classified into six categories A-F according to their structure characteristics and phylogenetic comparisons with Arabidopsis and rice. Polyploidy and segmental duplications in wheat were proved to be mainly responsible for the expansion of the wheat PG gene family.

Objective: We investigated monosensitization to peamaclein among Italian cypress pollen-allergic patients. A total of 835 cypress pollen-hypersensitive patients from 28 Italian allergy centers underwent a thorough work-up to determine food-allergic reactions and performed skin prick testing with a commercial peach extract containing peamaclein. IgE to rPru&#xa0;p&#xa0;3 was measured in peach reactors, and those with negative results were enrolled as potentially monosensitized to peamaclein. IgE reactivity to rPru&#xa0;p&#xa0;7 was evaluated using immunoblot and an experimental ImmunoCAP with rPru&#xa0;p&#xa0;7. Skin prick tests were positive to peach in 163 patients (19.5%); however, 127 (77.9%) were excluded because they reacted to Pru&#xa0;p&#xa0;3. Twenty-four patients (14.7%) corresponding to 2.8% of the entire study population) were considered potentially monosensitized to peamaclein. No geographic preference was observed. Seventeen of the 24 patients (70.8%) had a history of food allergy, mainly to peach (n=15). Additional offending foods included other Rosaceae, citrus fruits, fig, melon, tree nuts, and kiwi. On peach immunoblot, only 3 of 18 putative peamaclein-allergic patients reacted to a band at about 7 kDa; an additional 4 patients reacted at about 50-60&#xa0;kDa. Ten of 18 patients (56%) had a positive result for Pru p 7 on ImmunoCAP. Allergy and sensitization to peamaclein seem rare in Italy.

Nutritional deficiencies in musts can lead to olfactory defects and a decline in quality. Commercial activators and nutrients are usually added to the must in these cases. The natural composition of bee pollen can provide all the necessary nutrients for yeasts. This investigation aims to analyze the impact of pollen addition on the profile of volatile and sensory compounds in Tintilla de Rota warm climate red wines. Volatile compounds were measured by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Odorant Activity Values analysis to find out each compound's fragrant participation, and sensorial analysis was conducted for a qualified panel of wine-tasters. As a result of the chromatographic analysis, 80 volatile compounds of different chemical families were identified and quantified. Bee pollen increased mainly isoamyl alcohol, esters, and terpenes compounds families in wines. Odorant Activity Values analysis showed an increase in fruity odorant series mainly, followed by floral, for all wines with pollen addition. The sensory analysis showed that low pollen doses (0.1 g/L and 0.25 g/L) increased tasting notes of fruit and floral attributes and fruit and floral odorant series as well, highlighting an increase in red and black fruit notes mainly. On the other hand, high doses deviated the sensory profile towards fleshy stone fruit, and raisin fruit, mostly. In addition, high bee pollen doses produce an increase in the odorant category responsible for the chemical, fatty, and grassy aromas mainly, and high and intermediate dose (1 g/L) an increase in the earthy notes in the aromas. Therefore, low bee pollen doses (0.1 and 0.25 g/L) can improve both the aromatic compound profile, as well as the Odorant Activity Values levels and the sensory profile in Tintilla de Rota red wines.",10.3390/foods9080981,32718060,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:23:04.959565-04:00,No,,

The cone was studied from serial thin sections prepared by the coal ball peel technique. Phylogenetic analysis using a modified morphological matrix with both discrete and continuous characters was performed using TNT version 1.5. The nearly spherical cone, 6 &#xd7; 6 cm in diameter, has helically arranged cone-scale complexes, consisting of a large bract with an upturned tip and a small, fleshy ovuliferous scale. Vascularization of the cone-scale complex is single at its origin. Widely winged bracts, with a bulging base, contain numerous vascular bundles, interspersed with transfusion tissue, and a large number of resin canals. Seeds are ovoid, 1.2 cm long, 1.2 cm in diameter. Nucellus is free from the integument, except at its base, with a convoluted apex, containing possible pollen tubes. Megagametophytes and mature cellular embryos occur in several seeds.

The resulting raw data reads were processed and further analyzed by using only freely available web-based tools (the Shovill pipeline, QUAST, BAGEL4, ResFinder, VirulenceFinder and PlasmidFinder). The analysis revealed that both of them represent clonally identical isolates of the same strain. This specific strain was named Enterococcus faecium EFD, and was genotyped by the MLST-2.0 Server.

In this study, we first established a reporter assay system in yeast to verify the cleavage activity of the Arabidopsis thaliana SPP (AtSPP). Next, we screened candidate substrates of AtSPP from A. thaliana pollen and roots. In the pollen, 13 signal peptides with 'pollen' and 'cell wall' as gene ontology terms were selected. In the roots, mutants overexpressing AtSPP were constructed, and gene expression changes were compared with the wild-type. Nine signal peptides expressed in the roots were selected.

The molecular mechanism that regulates the crucial role of callose in production of functional male gametophytes remains completely unexplored. Here, we provide evidence that the gradual upregulation of a previously uncharacterized cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) pollen-specific SKS-like protein (PSP231), specifically at the post pollen-mitosis stage, activates callose biosynthesis to promote pollen maturation. Aberrant <i>PSP231</i> expression levels caused by either silencing or overexpression resulted in late pollen developmental abnormalities and male infertility phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of fine-tuned <i>PSP231</i> expression. Mechanistic analyses revealed that PSP231 plays a central role in triggering and fine-tuning the callose synthesis and deposition required for pollen development. Specifically, PSP231 protein sequesters the cellular pool of RNA-binding protein GhRBPL1 to destabilize <i>GhWRKY15</i> mRNAs, turning off GhWRKY15-mediated transcriptional repression of <i>GhCalS4</i>/<i>GhCalS8</i> and thus activating callose biosynthesis in pollen.

To better understand these relationships, we studied the habitat selection of Bombus pauloensis by tracking 17 queen bumblebees with radio telemetry in blueberry fields in Entre R&#xed;os province, Argentina. To evaluate land use and floral resources used by bumblebees, we tracked bees before and after nest establishment and estimated home ranges using minimum convex polygons and kernel density methods. We also classified the pollen on their bodies to identify the floral resources they used from the floral species available at that time. We characterized land use for each bee as the relative proportion of GPS points inside of each land use. Bumblebees differed markedly in their movement behavior in relation to pre and post nest establishment. Bees moved over larger areas, and mostly within blueberry fields, before nest establishment. In contrast, after establishing the nest, the bees preferred the edges near forest plantations and they changed the nutritional resources to prefer wild floral species. Our study is the first to track queen bumblebee movements in an agricultural setting and relate movement changes across time and space with pollen resource availability.

A population of 408 asthmatic individuals aged 10-35&#xa0;years were investigated. Information on hypersensitivity symptoms upon intake of peanut or hazelnut were recorded in a standardized questionnaire. Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), blood eosinophil count (B-Eos), spirometry, methacholine challenge outcome and IgE antibodies to peanut and hazelnut allergens were measured by standard clinical and laboratory methods. Subjects sensitized to any of the peanut (Ara h 1, 2 or 3) or hazelnut (Cor a 9 or 14) storage proteins were significantly younger (17.6 vs 21.2&#xa0;years), had higher levels of FeNO (23.2 vs 16.7&#xa0;ppb) and B-Eos (340 vs 170&#xa0;cells/mcl) than those displaying only pollen-related cross-reactive sensitization.

In addition, honey production takes place in various environments, and polluted environment is often hard to detect. It impacts both human and beehive health, especially through honey which is used for human consumption. Pollen analysis was conducted by a novel approach through a multivariate principal component analysis where it was possible to obtain grouping patterns related to foraging plant species. Samples of honey were acquired from three different environmental production systems: (i) honey from the apiaries in the vicinity of thermal power plant, (ii) apiary of certified organic production and (iii) the conventional production with semi-controlled production. Significantly higher contents of the Pb, Cd and Zn are found in the analysed honeys taken near the thermal power plant compared with those of the other analysed honeys. The origin of Zn, Pb and Cd in the honey is the contaminated forage plants and foraging honeybees. Honey from certified organic production differentiated significantly from other two types of production by the water content, electrical conductivity and total soluble solids and notably it contained significantly less ash and lead. There is a clear advantage of certified organic honey in terms of heavy metal residues as the most prominent pollution factor in honey. Therefore, honey can be used as the broad range environmental pollution indicator, as bees will forage on polluted plants and bring the pollutant from a wide spatial range inside the hive, where it can be traced in the honey.

In order to answer this question, preanthesis pollen grains of Cyperaceae individuals were analyzed under different tools such as light and transmission electron microscopy, which included cytochemistry and immunogold procedures. The results showed that maturing pollen in Cyperaceae presents some unusual endomembrane behaviors. Endoplasmic reticulum and dictyosomes are concerned in classic secretion pathways in vegetative cells, and possibly the late breakdown of degenerative microspores. However, cortical and concentric endoplasmic reticulum are also present and are possibly related to other functions aside the biosynthetic pathway. Unconventional secretion of large membrane-bound bodies containing cell wall precursors was also observed and confirmed by immunogold. However, since these bodies most likely receive material from dictyosomes, as observed in silver nitrate reaction, the """"unconventional"""" status of this secretion is debatable. Reports of the literature show that these unusual endomembrane formations are not exclusive of the sedge pollen, but little attention have been given to them so far.

AM fungi associate with plant roots, uptake nutrients, and prime plants for faster defense responses. Our literature review first identified four testable hypotheses describing how AM fungi could alter pollen delivery: (1) We hypothesize AM fungi promote floral display size. The influence of AM fungi on flower size and number is supported by literature, however there are no studies on floral color. (2) We hypothesize AM fungi promote pollen and nectar quality and quantity, and, as reported before, AM fungi promote male fitness over female fitness. (3) We hypothesize AM fungi promote both earlier and longer flowering times, but we found no consistent trend in the data for earlier or later or longer flowering times. (4) We hypothesize AM fungi alter floral secondary chemistry and VOCs, and find there is clear evidence for the alteration of floral chemistry but little data on VOCs. Second, we focus on how AM fungi could alter pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fertilization, and present three testable hypotheses. We found evidence that AM fungi influence pollen germination and pollen tube growth, production of seeds, and seed germination. However, while most of these influences are positive they are not conclusive, because studies have been conducted in small numbers of systems and groups.

Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are conserved protein kinases in eukaryotes that establish signaling circuits to transduce information from outer plant cell membrane to the nucleus of plant cells, eventually activating processes directing growth, development, stress responses, and disease resistance. Plant RLKs share considerable homology with the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of the animal system, differing at the site of phosphorylation. Typically, RLKs have a membrane-localization signal in the amino-terminal, followed by an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a solitary membrane-spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. The functional characterization of ligand-binding domains of the various RLKs has demonstrated their essential role in the perception of extracellular stimuli, while its cytosolic kinase domain is usually confined to the phosphorylation of their substrates to control downstream regulatory machinery. Identification of the several ligands of RLKs, as well as a few of its immediate substrates have predominantly contributed to a better understanding of the fundamental signaling mechanisms. In the model plant Arabidopsis, several studies have indicated that multiple RLKs are involved in modulating various types of physiological roles via diverse signaling routes.

Obesity is one of the risk factors associated with the increased formation of renal calculi. We aimed to assess whether obesity also increases the recurrence rate of nephrolithiasis. Methods We retrospectively identified and collected data of 283 adult patients with renal stones who were managed at our hospital from November 2018 to November 2021. The demographic information, comorbidities, stone burden, and treatment methods related to them were identified, collected, and analyzed. Moreover, we performed the chi-squared test (&#x3c7;2) and multivariate logistic regression analysis in order to assess the risk factors (i.e., independent predictors) of recurrence among the studied patients. Additionally, the odds ratio (OR) was calculated at a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. A <i>p</i>-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of the 283 adult patients we analyzed, 35 did not meet the criteria of our study and, consequently, were excluded. Therefore, we ended up with 248 patients, of whom 179 (68.1%) were males, 131 (52.8%) had a previous history of renal stones, and 90 (36.3%) had chronic illnesses. Moreover, the mean age of the studied patients was 48.91 &#xb1; 14.51 years, and the mean BMI was 29.44 &#xb1; 6.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. It was found that most of the patients (35.5%) had only one stone, while 23.4% of them had more than 5 stones. Furthermore, the majority of the stones (35.9%) were medium size (with a stone diameter of 10-19 mm [1-1.9 cm]). We did not find a relationship between obesity and the recurrence rate of renal stones. However, there was a significant association (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) between the recurrence rate and Saudi nationality, chronic diseases (more specifically, HTN), unilateral stones, and a stone diameter of 10-19 mm (1-1.9 cm).

Fibromyxoid nephrogenic adenoma is a rare variant that consists of compressed spindle-shaped renal epithelial cells in a fibromyxoid background. Only 14 observations of this variant are reported in the literature. We performed a retrospective analysis of fibromyxoid nephrogenic adenomas from 3 large reference centers. We identified 43 lesions in 6 women and 36 men (2 in 1 man) with a median age of 72 years (range, 31 to 94&#xa0;y). Median lesion size was 0.7&#xa0;cm (range, 0.2 to 5&#xa0;cm). Nephrogenic adenomas were in the bladder (n=15), prostate/prostatic urethra (n=14), kidney (n=7), ureter (n=3), penile urethra (n=3), and urethral diverticulum (n=1). One of the kidney lesions developed in an end-stage kidney and radiologically mimicked cancer.

The objectives of this study were to use a cross-sectional survey targeting cat owners within the United States and Canada, to explore perspectives on cat scratching behavior and management strategies, as well as identify factors that influence the performance of inappropriate scratching behavior in the household. A total of 2465 cat owners participated in the survey and three mixed logistic regression models were generated to explore associations between (1) cat demographic factors, (2) provisions of enrichment, and (3) owner demographic and management factors with owner reports of problematic scratching. In this convenience sample, inappropriate scratching was reported by 58% of cat owners. Owner perspectives and management strategies aligned with current recommendations as they preferred to use appropriate surfaces (e.g., cat trees) and training to manage scratching as opposed to surrendering, euthanizing, or declawing. Logistic regression results found fewer reports of unwanted scratching behavior if owners provide enrichment (flat scratching surfaces (p = 0.037), sisal rope (p &lt; 0.0001), and outdoor access (p = 0.01)), reward the use of appropriate scratching objects (p = 0.007), apply attractant to preferred items (p &lt; 0.0001), restrict access to unwanted items (p &lt; 0.0001), provide additional scratching posts (p &lt; 0.0001), and if their cat is 7 years of age or older (p &lt; 0.00001).

5598,Evaluation of the safety of using harmonic scalpel during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in children: A preliminary report.,,,,,children; cholecystectomy; cystic duct; harmonic scalpel; laparoscopic surgery,Frontiers in pediatrics,Front Pediatr,17,09,2022,"In spite of being one of the most common surgical procedures performed in adults, laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is relatively uncommon in the pediatric age group. Most surgeons prefer to dissect the cystic duct using a monopolar electrosurgical hook and occlude it with simple metal clips. Although the safety of using the ultrasonically-activated shears, e.g., harmonic scalpel for dissection of the gallbladder is confirmed in many studies, its efficacy in the closure of the cystic artery and duct in adults is still debatable. Furthermore, very few reports studied its safety in children during LC. The aim of our work is to study the safety and efficacy of ultrasonic shears in controlling the cystic duct and artery during LC in children. A prospective study was conducted from May 2017 to April 2020, where all children having symptomatic gallbladder stone disease were included in the study. HS was used as a sole instrument in gallbladder dissection as well as in controlling cystic duct and artery. No metal clips or sutures were used throughout the procedure. A total of forty-two children having symptomatic gallstone disease were included in the study. The main indication for LC was hemolytic anemia. Their age ranged from 3 to 13 years with a mean of 8.4 &#xb1; 3.25 years. All operations were completed laparoscopically, i.e., no conversion to open surgery was needed. The mean operative time was 40 &#xb1; 10.42 min. There were no intraoperative complications apart from gall bladder perforation in two cases during dissection from the liver bed while the postoperative recovery was smooth in all patients. Patients started oral feeding after 11.30 &#xb1; 3.01 h. The mean time for discharge was 25.47 &#xb1; 7.49 h, ranging from 14 to 48 h. Postoperative ultrasound for all cases showed no evidence of minor or major bile leaks or CBD injuries. This is the first report to evaluate the use of HS as a sole instrument during LC in the pediatric age group.

Based on research identifying key dimensions of equity-oriented health care as being cultural safety, harm reduction and trauma- and violence-informed care, an intervention to promote equity at the organizational level was tested in primary health care, refined and adapted, and tested in Emergency Departments (EDs). In partnership with clinical, community and Indigenous leaders in three diverse EDs in one Canadian province, we supported direct care staff to tailor and implement the intervention. Intervention activities varied in type and intensity at each site. Survey data were collected pre- and post-intervention from every consecutive patient over age 18 presenting to the EDs (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4771) with 3315 completing post-visit questions in 4 waves at two sites and 3 waves (due to pandemic constraints) at the third. Administrative data were collected for 12&#x2009;months pre- and 12&#x2009;months post-intervention. Throughout the study period, the participating EDs were dealing with a worsening epidemic of overdoses and deaths related to a toxic drug supply, and the COVID 19 pandemic curtailed both intervention activities and data collection. Despite these constraints, staff at two of the EDs mounted equity-oriented intervention strategies; the other site was experiencing continued, significant staff shortages and leadership changeover. Longitudinal analysis using multiple regression showed non-significant but encouraging trends in patient perceptions of quality of care and patient experiences of discrimination in the ED. Subgroup analysis showed that specific groups of patients experienced care in significantly different ways at each site. An interrupted time series of administrative data showed no significant change in staff sick time, but showed a significant decrease in the percentage of patients who left without care being completed at the site with the most robust intervention activities. The trends in patient perceptions and the significant decrease in the percentage of patients who left without care being completed suggest potential for impact. Realization of this potential will depend on readiness, commitment and resources at the organizational and systems levels.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the modified technique comparing with laparoscopic choledochotomy. Retrospective analysis of the clinical data of patients with hepatolithiasis or choledocholithiasis consulted at our hospital from February 2018 to December 2021. The cases were divided into two groups according to surgical modality, intraoperative ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic lithotripsy (IUG-PTCSL) and laparoscopic choledochotomy lithotripsy (LC-L). Contrast analysis determined the advantages of the two approaches. IUG-PTCSL was performed in 44 patients, aged 58.14&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;14.01&#xa0;years, including 9 male and 35 female.

The patient position for PCNL has been classically divided into prone or supine and the prone position is more commonly used. One of the most feared complications of this surgical technique is colon injury and the objective of this work is to evaluate the incidence of retrorenal colon (RRC) both supine and prone position, in pediatric patients, through radiological images. A retrosepctive review was performed of all abdominal CT scans performed in one center, in patients under 18 years since 2017 to 2019. The ideal path for percutaneous puncture was traced in the upper, middle, and lower calyces of both kidneys in the prone and supine positions and contact with the kidney and adjacent organs was evaluated, with a uro-radiologist. Chi-square test and Student's t test were applied. 50 CT-scans were performed on 44 children. Patients had a mean age of 12.6 years and 71.4% were male. Twenty-five scans were performed in the prone and 25 in the supine position. The incidence of RRC for the left kidney (LK) was significantly higher in the lower calyx in prone position than in the supine position, 28% vs 4% (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.049), and the right kidney (RK) presented RRC only in the prone position. The liver was the most frequent retrorenal organ (97.7%) for the RK, with a non-significant difference by position, while for the LK the spleen was the most frequent (61.1%). Colon injury is one of the most morbid complication in PCNL and one of the reasons to perform a CT scan before surgery, on which its incidence appears to be &lt;1% in adults. The present study revealed RRC to be present in three (12%) patients in the supine position and seven (28%) patients in the prone position (p=0.15). These results were slightly higher from those reported in adults (supine: 1.7%-10%; prone: 6.8%-20%), but there are no reports in the literature on this issue to allow appropriate comparison. This is the first study to attempt to assess the incidence of RRC in children according to position.

This randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus baricitinib 4 mg once daily by mouth for 10 days or until discharge if sooner (baricitinib group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A meta-analysis was done, which included the results from the RECOVERY trial and all previous randomised controlled trials of baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381936) and is ongoing. Between Feb 2 and Dec 29, 2021, from 10&#x2008;852 enrolled, 8156 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus baricitinib versus usual care alone. At randomisation, 95% of patients were receiving corticosteroids and 23% were receiving tocilizumab (with planned use within the next 24 h recorded for a further 9%). Overall, 514 (12%) of 4148 patients allocated to baricitinib versus 546 (14%) of 4008 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (age-adjusted rate ratio 0&#xb7;87; 95% CI 0&#xb7;77-0&#xb7;99; p=0&#xb7;028). This 13% proportional reduction in mortality was somewhat smaller than that seen in a meta-analysis of eight previous trials of a JAK inhibitor (involving 3732 patients and 425 deaths), in which allocation to a JAK inhibitor was associated with a 43% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0&#xb7;57; 95% CI 0&#xb7;45-0&#xb7;72). Including the results from RECOVERY in an updated meta-analysis of all nine completed trials (involving 11&#x2008;888 randomly assigned patients and 1485 deaths) allocation to baricitinib or another JAK inhibitor was associated with a 20% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0&#xb7;80; 95% CI 0&#xb7;72-0&#xb7;89; p&lt;0&#xb7;0001). In RECOVERY, there was no significant excess in death or infection due to non-COVID-19 causes and no significant excess of thrombosis, or other safety outcomes. In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, baricitinib significantly reduced the risk of death but the size of benefit was somewhat smaller than that suggested by previous trials. The total randomised evidence to date suggests that JAK inhibitors (chiefly baricitinib) reduce mortality in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 by about one-fifth.

Between 2018 and 2021, 20 children underwent 30 ERCP procedures at the Bangladesh Specialized Hospital, Dhaka. A single trained adult gastroenterologist performed all procedures using a therapeutic video duodenoscope. The indications for ERCP, diagnostic findings, therapeutic procedures, and complications were documented. The median age of the study patients was 10 years (range, 1.7-15 years). Successful cannulation of the papilla was achieved in 28 procedures and failed in 2 cases. Repeated ERCP was required in seven patients. Nine patients had biliary indications and 11 had pancreatic indications. Choledocholithiasis was the most common indication for ERCP in patients with biliary disease, while chronic pancreatitis was common among patients with pancreatic indications.

Fluvial gravel terrace sites in the east of Britain and north of France provide a majority of the data contributing to this understanding, mostly through the presence or absence of stone-tool artefacts. To date, however, relatively few sites have been radiometrically dated, and many have not been excavated in modern times, leading to an over-reliance on selectively sampled and poorly dated lithic assemblages. This includes Fordwich (Kent, UK), where over 330 bifaces were discovered through industrial quarrying in the 1920s. Here, we present the first excavation and dating of artefacts discovered <i>in situ</i> at Fordwich, alongside their technological analysis and relationship to those previously recovered. The site is demonstrated to retain deposits of Lower Palaeolithic artefacts, with 251 flakes, scrapers and cores identified to date. Infrared-radiofluorescence (IR-RF) dating of feldspar reveals 112 artefacts to have come from levels dating to at least 570 &#xb1; 36 to 513 &#xb1; 30 thousand years ago (ka) and are most plausibly assigned to an MIS 14 deposition, with artefacts produced during MIS 15 (approx. 560-620 ka). Indeed, these IR-RF samples provide minimum ages for artefacts. Combined with evidence from exposures linked to the original quarrying activities, a similar MIS 15 age is suggested for the more than 330 handaxe artefacts discovered in the 1920s. The remaining excavated artefacts come from levels dated to between 347 &#xb1; 22 and 385 &#xb1; 21 ka (MIS 10 or 11), with this later age interpreted to reflect post-MIS 14 deposition by substrate gullying and solifluction. These data demonstrate Fordwich to be one of the earliest Palaeolithic sites in northwestern Europe, and to retain the only large Acheulean handaxe assemblage directly dated to pre-MIS 13. Thus, Fordwich is determined to be a crucial piece of the pre-Anglian Palaeolithic puzzle in northern Europe.",10.1098/rsos.211904,35754990,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 01:06:01.311667-04:00,No,,

Household air pollution from cooking using biomass is a major contributor to overall exposure in rural low-income settings. Previous research in Malawi has revealed how precarity and food insecurity shape individuals' daily experiences, contributing to perceptions of health. Aiming to avoid a mismatch between research intervention and local context, we introduced a simple cookstove intervention in rural Malawi, analysing change in fine particulate matter (PM <sub>2.5</sub>) exposures, and community perceptions. <b>Methods:</b> Following a period of baseline ethnographic research, we distributed <i>'chitetezo mbaula'</i>, locally-made cookstoves, to all households (n=300) in a rural Malawian village. Evaluation incorporated village-wide participant observation and concurrent exposure monitoring using portable PM <sub>2.5</sub> monitors at baseline and follow-up (three months post-intervention). Qualitative data were thematically analysed. Quantitative analysis of exposure data included pre-post intervention comparisons, with datapoints divided into periods of combustion activity (almost exclusively cooking) and non-combustion periods. Findings were integrated at the interpretation stage, using a convergent design mode of synthesis. <b>Results:</b> Individual exposure monitoring pre- and post-cookstove intervention&#xa0;involved a sample of 18 participants (15 female; mean age 43).

Stoves were well-liked and widely used by residents as substitutes for previous cooking methods (mainly three-stone fires). Commonly cited benefits related to fuel saving and shorter cooking times. <b>Conclusions:</b> The cookstove intervention had no impact on cooking-related PM <sub>2.5</sub> exposures.

Children with a reported history of penicillin allergy admitted to our children's hospital were risk-stratified and those stratified as low-risk underwent a single-dose oral challenge by a central pharmacist, regardless of the need for antibiotics. After the completion of each patient's delabeling process, surveys were distributed to health care personnel involved in the patient's care to collect perceptions on the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of this intervention. Measures were scored by using a 5-point Likert scale. Of the 23 patients who screened as low-risk, 20 underwent a penicillin allergy evaluation and an oral challenge. Of these, the penicillin allergy label was removed in 19 (95%) patients (Fig 1). The median age was 7 years (range 11 months-18 years). Participants rated the risk stratification and delabeling favorably overall, with high ratings on all 3 implementation measures: acceptability (mean 4.55, &#xb1; standard deviation [STD] 0.65), appropriateness (mean 4.58, STD &#xb1; 0.6), and feasibility (mean 4.51, STD &#xb1; 0.73).

In this study, we propose that such low-quality responding (LQR) can carry substantive meaning at older ages. Completing questionnaires is a cognitively demanding task and LQR among older adults may reflect early signals of cognitive deficits and pathological aging. We hypothesized that older people displaying greater LQR would show faster cognitive decline and greater mortality risk. We analyzed data from 9, 288 adults 65 years or older in the Health and Retirement Study. Indicators of LQR were derived from participants' response patterns in 102 psychosocial questionnaire items administered in 2006-2008. Latent growth models examined whether LQR predicted initial status and change in cognitive functioning, assessed with the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, over the subsequent 10 years. Discrete-time survival models examined whether LQR was associated with mortality risk over the 10 years. We also examined evidence for indirect (mediated) effects in which LQR predicts mortality via cognitive trajectories. After adjusting for age, gender, race, marital status, education, health conditions, smoking status, physical activity, and depressive symptoms, greater LQR was cross-sectionally associated with poorer cognitive functioning, and prospectively associated with faster cognitive decline over the follow-up period. Furthermore, greater LQR was associated with increased mortality risk during follow-up, and this effect was partially accounted for by the associations between LQR and cognitive functioning. Self-report questionnaires are not formally designed as cognitive tasks, but this study shows that LQR indicators derived from self-report measures provide objective, performance-based information about individuals' cognitive functioning and survival. Self-report surveys are ubiquitous in social science, and indicators of LQR may be of broad relevance as predictors of cognitive and health trajectories in older people.",10.1093/geroni/igac027,35663275,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 01:41:58.613455-04:00,No,,

We therefore evaluated the association between body composition parameters and the prediction of retreatment after ESWL. Methods This study retrospectively evaluated 42 patients with CP who had been treated with ESWL between 2008 and 2019 in a single center. Body composition parameters were measured on pretreatment computed tomography images. Patients who underwent repeat ESWL were classified as the retreatment group. Results There were 13 (31.0%) and 29 (69.0%) patients in the retreatment and non-retreatment groups, respectively. The visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio (VSR) of the retreatment group was significantly lower than that of the non-retreatment group (p=0.016). When divided by the median VSR, 10 of the 20 patients with a VSR of &lt;0.85 underwent retreatment, whereas 3 of the 22 patients with a VSR of &#x2265;0.85 underwent retreatment (p=0.019).

The age of the fossil-bearing breccia ranges between 164-131 kyr, based on the Bayesian modelling of luminescence dating of the sedimentary matrix from which it was recovered, U-series dating of an overlying flowstone, and U-series-ESR dating of associated faunal teeth. Analyses of the internal structure of the molar in tandem with palaeoproteomic analyses of the enamel indicate that the tooth derives from a young, likely female, Homo individual.

Ancient specimens were enriched for the mitochondrial genome using an in-solution hybridization protocol and modern specimens were subjected to shotgun sequencing. Sequences were mapped to the <i>Ovis aries</i> reference genome, assigned to haplogroups and subhaplogroups, and used to calculate a phylogenetic tree using previously published, geographically dispersed mitochondrial genome sheep sequences. Genetic diversity statistics show that southern African sheep have lower diversity than sheep in other regions.

This phenomenon is explained by a stark difference in case demographic between the two countries. Using this as a motivating example, we introduce basic concepts from mediation analysis and show how these can be used to quantify different direct and indirect effects when assuming a coarse-grained causal graph involving country, age, and case fatality. We curate an age-stratified cfr dataset with [Formula: see text]750&#xa0;k cases and conduct a case study, investigating total, direct, and indirect (age-mediated) causal effects between different countries and at different points in time. This allows us to separate age-related effects from others unrelated to age and facilitates a more transparent comparison of cfrs across countries at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using longitudinal data from Italy, we discover a sign reversal of the direct causal effect in mid-March, which temporally aligns with the reported collapse of the healthcare system in parts of the country. Moreover, we find that direct and indirect effects across 132 pairs of countries are only weakly correlated, suggesting that a country's policy and case demographic may be largely unrelated. We point out limitations and extensions for future work, and finally, discuss the role of causal reasoning in the broader context of using AI to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. <i>Impact Statement</i>-During a global pandemic, understanding the causal effects of risk factors such as age on COVID-19 fatality is an important scientific question. Since randomised controlled trials are typically infeasible or unethical in this context, causal investigations based on observational data-such as the one carried out in this article-will, therefore, be crucial in guiding our understanding of the available data. Causal inference, in particular mediation analysis, can be used to resolve apparent statistical paradoxes; help educate the public and decision-makers alike; avoid unsound comparisons; and answer a range of causal questions pertaining to the pandemic, subject to transparently stated assumptions. Our exposition helps clarify how mediation analysis can be used to investigate direct and indirect effects along different causal paths and thus serves as a stepping stone for future studies of other important risk factors for COVID-19 besides age.",10.1109/TAI.2021.3073088,35233556,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:27:30.955958-04:00,No,,

Clinical data of consecutive patients undergoing first-ever ERCP for suspected choledocholithiasis from 2015-2019 were abstracted from a prospectively-maintained database. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify predictors of ERCP-confirmed choledocholithiasis. MLMs were then trained to predict ERCP-confirmed choledocholithiasis using pre-ERCP ultrasound (US) imaging only and separately using all available noninvasive imaging (US/CT/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography).

From &#x223c;3200 BC, the number, density, and extravagance of settlements increased, and new ceremonial monuments and ceramic styles, possibly originating in Orkney, spread across Britain and Ireland. By &#x223c;2800 BC, this phenomenon was waning, although Neolithic traditions persisted to at least 2500 BC. Unlike elsewhere in Britain, there is little material evidence to suggest a Beaker presence, suggesting that Orkney may have developed along an insular trajectory during the second millennium BC. We tested this by comparing new genomic evidence from 22 Bronze Age and 3 Iron Age burials in northwest Orkney with Neolithic burials from across the archipelago. We identified signals of inward migration on a scale unsuspected from the archaeological record: As elsewhere in Bronze Age Britain, much of the population displayed significant genome-wide ancestry deriving ultimately from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe. However, uniquely in northern and central Europe, most of the male lineages were inherited from the local Neolithic. This suggests that some male descendants of Neolithic Orkney may have remained distinct well into the Bronze Age, although there are signs that this had dwindled by the Iron Age. Furthermore, although the majority of mitochondrial DNA lineages evidently arrived afresh with the Bronze Age, we also find evidence for continuity in the female line of descent from Mesolithic Britain into the Bronze Age and even to the present day.",10.1073/pnas.2108001119,35131896,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 18:03:35.304068-04:00,No,,

Many treatments, namely, alpha-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, glyceryl trinitrate, and steroids, have been, therefore, utilized to mitigate such complications and accelerate stone expulsion. Several animal and human studies revealed the presence of &#x3b2;3-receptors in the ureter and bladder, where stimulating these receptors could relax the distal ureteral segment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of use of mirabegron as MET for distal ureteral stones (intramural and extramural). This is a prospective randomized controlled study including 90 patients who had distal ureteral stones less than 10 mm and were evaluated between January and June 2020. The patients were classified into 3 groups: group (A) 30 patients: mirabegron 50 mg d-1 + diclofenac Na 100 mg tab (to be taken only during colic episodes), group (B) 30 patients: tamsulosin HCL 0.4 mg cap + diclofenac Na 100 mg tab (to be taken only during colic episodes), and group (C) 30 patients: diclofenac Na 100 mg tab only (to be taken only during colic episodes). Age, sex, stone size, laterality, and grade of ureterohydronephrosis were recorded. Patients were observed for 30 days, and ureteroscopy was completed for those with nonexpulsed stones. Follow-up parameters included number of renal colic episodes, duration of medical therapy, stone expulsion time, and stone expulsion rate (SER). In the group (A), 2 (6.6%) patients were excluded due to nasal congestion, and 1 (3.3%) patient was excluded due to a 20-mm Hg systolic blood pressure increase.

The current study showed that gritty sensation (65.2%) and eye dryness (51.2%) were the commonest symptoms complained. By examination, conjunctival hyperemia (59.6%) was the most prevalent finding. By performing dry eye tests, dry eye was diagnosed in 60.4% and 51.2% of workers by Schirmer's test and tear break up time test respectively. The study's results indicated that age, working category, smoking, and diabetes had significant impact on development of ocular symptoms, while working duration, diabetes, smoking, ocular symptoms, and ocular foreign body had significant impact on development of dry eye disease. Implementation of engineering control measures, proper designing, and supply of eye PPE together with adequate health education to all workers about occupational health risks and preventive measures are recommended.",10.1007/s11356-021-18410-5,35066853,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:26:50.023536-04:00,No,,

In the current study, we both revisit the taxonomic affinities of these fossils and assess whether morphological differences between them reflect temporal evolution or sexual variation. We generated virtual reconstructions of the mostly complete &#x223c;1.55&#xa0;Ma DAN5/P1 calvaria and the less complete 1.26&#xa0;Ma BSN12/P1 fossil, allowing us to directly compare their anterior vault shapes using landmark-based shape analysis. The two fossils are similar in calvaria shape to H.&#xa0;erectus and also to other Early Pleistocene Homo species based on a geometric morphometric analysis of calvaria landmarks and semilandmarks. The DAN5/P1 fossil bears a particularly close affinity to the Georgian H.&#xa0;erectus fossils and to KNM-ER 1813 (H.&#xa0;habilis), probably reflecting allometric influences on vault shape. Combined with species-specific traits of the neurocranium (e.g., midline keeling, angular torus), we confirm that these fossils are likely early African H.&#xa0;erectus. We calculated regression-based estimates of endocranial volume for BSN12/P1 of 882-910&#xa0;cm<sup>3</sup> based on three virtual reconstructions. Although BSN12/P1 is markedly larger than DAN5/P1 (598&#xa0;cm<sup>3</sup>), both fossils represent the smallest adult H.&#xa0;erectus known from their respective time periods in Africa.

This randomized controlled trial tested whether statistically derived patient subgroups (high pain dysfunctional [HPD], high pain adaptive [HPA], and low pain adaptive [LPA]) moderated response to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for adolescents with FAP and their parents (n = 278 dyads; patients were 66% female, mean [SD] age was 14.62 [1.88] years, and parents were 95% female). Randomization to Internet-delivered CBT vs Internet-delivered pain education (EDU) was stratified by patient subgroup.

Significant treatment &#xd7; subgroup &#xd7; time interaction effects showed that patient subgroup significantly moderated the effect of treatment on GI symptoms (t[853 = -2.93, P = 0.003) and abdominal pain (t(844) = -2.14, P = 0.03) across the treatment period. Among HPD youth, those in CBT had significantly greater GI symptom reduction than those in EDU through posttreatment. By contrast, among HPA and LPA youth, symptom improvement did not differ by treatment condition. Furthermore, among all patients assigned to CBT, HPD youth demonstrated significantly greater reductions in GI symptoms compared with HPA and LPA youth and greater reductions in abdominal pain compared with LPA youth.

This study included 97 patients having presented in the emergency department with acute renal colic and were diagnosed as having ureteral stones on a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NCCT). The ureteric jet frequency was measured by Doppler ultrasonography by our radiologist with the Hitachi Aloka F-37 ultrasound machine&#xa0;after they underwent CT. Patients were asked to drink 750-1000 ml of liquids 15-20 minutes before their ultrasonographic examination of both kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladder. The kidney size (length and width) and presence/absence of hydronephrosis were evaluated by grayscale ultrasound. Then, with the help of color Doppler ultrasonography, the frequency of the ureteric jet was recorded. The patient's mean age was 46.66 &#xb1; 3.21 years ranging from 37 to 56 years. There were 58 (59.8%) male and 39 (40.2%) female cases. The mean cumulative stone size was 9.77 &#xb1; 2.65 mm. According to stone location, 44 (45.4%) cases had upper ureteric, 24 (24.7%) cases had mid ureteric, and 29 (29.9%) cases had lower ureteric stone.

Some research has shown that this gap is less pronounced among older compared to younger adults for self-reported negative affect, but it is not known whether these age differences are evident consistently across domains of well-being and why these age differences emerge. In this study, we examined age differences in the memory-experience gap for emotional (positive and negative affect), social (loneliness), and physical (pain, fatigue) well-being. We also tested four variables that could plausibly explain age differences in the gap: (a) episodic memory and executive functioning, (b) the age-related positivity effect, (c) variability of daily experiences, and (d) socially desirable responding. Adults (n = 477) from three age groups (21-44, 45-64, 65+ years old) participated in a 21-day diary study. Participants completed daily end-of-day ratings and retrospective ratings of the same constructs over different recall periods (3, 7, 14, and 21 days). Results showed that, relative to young and middle-aged adults, older adults had a smaller memory-experience gap for negative affect and loneliness. Lower day-to-day variability partly explained why the gap was smaller for older adults. There was no evidence that the magnitude of the memory-experience gap for positive affect, pain or fatigue depended on age.

In hybrid zones, reproductive boundaries between species are tested and demography mediates the opportunity for admixture between lineages that are partially isolated. Genomic ancestry is a powerful tool for revealing the history of admixed populations, but models and methods based on local ancestry are rarely applied to structured hybrid zones. To understand the effects of demography on ancestry in hybrids zones, we performed individual-based simulations under a stepping-stone model, treating migration rate, deme size, and hybrid zone age as parameters. We find that the number of ancestry junctions (the transition points between genomic regions with different ancestries) and heterogenicity (the genomic proportion heterozygous for ancestry) are often closely connected to demographic history. Reducing deme size reduces junction number and heterogenicity. Elevating migration rate increases heterogenicity, but migration affects junction number in more complex ways. We highlight the junction frequency spectrum as a novel and informative summary of ancestry that responds to demographic history. A substantial proportion of junctions are expected to fix when migration is limited or deme size is small, changing the shape of the spectrum.

Environmental variability increases throughout the mid- to late-Pleistocene, superimposed by precession-paced packets of variability modulated by eccentricity. An interval of particularly high-amplitude climate and environmental variability occurred from &#x223c;275 ka to &#x223c;180 ka, synchronous with evidence for the first H.&#xa0;sapiens fossils in eastern Africa. These results support the 'variability selection hypothesis' that increased environmental variability selected for adaptable traits, behaviors, and technology in our hominin ancestors.",10.1016/j.jhevol.2021.103028,34216947,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 18:15:49.265083-04:00,No,,

Here, we combine pathway-based MRI measures of structural and functional connectivity to construct a metric of functional decline in MS. The Structural and Functional Connectivity Index (SFCI) is proposed as a simple, z-scored metric of structural and functional connectivity, where changes in the metric have a simple statistical interpretation and may be suitable for use in clinical trials. Using data collected at six time points from a 2-year longitudinal study of 20 participants with MS and 9 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, we probe two common symptomatic domains, motor and cognitive function, by measuring structural and functional connectivity in the transcallosal motor pathway and posterior cingulum bundle. The SFCI is significantly lower in participants with MS compared to controls (p = 0.009) and shows a significant decrease over time in MS (p = 0.012). The change in SFCI over two years performed favorably compared to measures of brain parenchymal fraction and lesion volume, relating to follow-up measures of processing speed (r = 0.60, p = 0.005), verbal fluency (r = 0.57, p = 0.009), and score on the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (r = 0.67, p = 0.003).

In this study we quantified selected populations of specific urinary EVs carrying protein markers of immune cells and calcium/phosphorus physiology in calcium oxalate stone formers (CSFs) compared to non-stone formers (NSFs). Biobanked urine samples from CSFs (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;24) undergoing stone removal surgery and age- and sex- matched NSFs (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) were studied. Urinary EVs carrying proteins related to renal calcium/phosphorus physiology (phosphorus transporters (PiT1 and PiT2), Klotho, and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23); markers associated with EV generation (anoctamin-4 (ANO4) and Huntington interacting protein 1 (HIP1)), and markers shed from activated immune cells were quantified by standardized and published method of digital flow cytometry.

The patient also underwent systemic review with detailed cardiac, brain and renal investigations. During follow-up, genetic analysis using whole-exome sequencing was performed on the patient and her parents to identify disease-causing variants. The patient's main complaint was of a recent onset of bilateral photophobia and blurred vision in the left eye. On examination, the most striking retinal finding was of bilateral well-demarcated, anterior circumferential chorioretinal atrophy with scattered pigment clumping from the mid periphery to the ora. In addition, she had posterior pole RPE hypopigmentation, peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy, left macular choroidal folds and retinal vasculature tortuosity with atypical branching. Her retinal electrophysiology was consistent with a cone rod photoreceptor dystrophy and left macular dysfunction. Ten years later, her BCVA, the anterior circumferential chorioretinal atrophy and her visual field constriction all remained stable. Her retinal electrophysiology demonstrated deterioration of left rod function, while cone dysfunction remained stable. Macular function deteriorated in both eyes. During follow-up, she was also noted to have progressive aortic root dilatation, posterior embryotoxon and an x ray diagnosis of butterfly vertebrae.

Are coagulation and fibrinolytic factors disrupted in Andean highlanders with excessive erythrocytosis? What is the main finding and its importance? Excessive erythrocytosis is not associated with prothombotic disruptions in coagulation or the fibrinolytic system in Andean highlanders. Impairments in coagulation and fibrinolysis may not contribute to the increased vascular risk associated with excessive erythrocytosis. Increased coagulation and reduced fibrinolysis are central factors underlying thrombotic risk and events. High altitude-induced excessive erythrocytosis (EE) is prevalent in Andean highlanders, contributing to increased cardiovascular risk. Disruption in the coagulation-fibrinolytic axis resulting in uncontrolled fibrin deposition might underlie the increased thrombotic risk associated with high-altitude EE. The experimental aim of this study was to determine whether EE is associated with a prothrombotic blood coagulation and fibrinolytic profile in Andean highlanders.

Both ultrasound and CT scan can be used for diagnosis, but the vast majority of patients receive a CT scan. Diagnostic pathways utilizing ultrasound have been shown to decrease radiation exposure to patients but are potentially less accurate. Because of these and other trade-offs, this decision has been proposed as appropriate for Shared Decision-Making (SDM), where clinicians and patients discuss clinical options and their consequences and arrive at a decision together. We developed a decision aid to facilitate SDM in this scenario. The objective of this study is to determine the effects of this decision aid, as compared to usual care, on patient knowledge, radiation exposure, engagement, safety, and healthcare utilization. This is the protocol for an adaptive randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of the intervention-a decision aid (""""Kidney Stone Choice"""")-on patient-centered outcomes, compared with usual care. Patients age 18-55 presenting to the emergency department with signs and symptoms consistent with acute uncomplicated ureterolithiasis will be consecutively enrolled and randomized.

If index visit pain severity is associated with stone size or with subsequent failure of conservative management, then it might be useful in identifying patients who would benefit from early definitive imaging or intervention. Our objectives were to determine whether pain severity correlates with stone size, and to evaluate its utility in predicting important outcomes. We used administrative data and structured chart review to study all ED patients with CT proven renal colic at six hospitals in two cities over one-year. Triage nurses recorded arrival numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores. We excluded patients with missing pain assessments and stratified eligible patients into severe (NRS 8-10) and less-severe pain groups. Stone parameters were abstracted from imaging reports, while hospitalizations and interventions were identified in hospital databases. We determined the classification accuracy of pain severity for stones &gt;5mm and used multivariable regression to determine the association of pain severity with 60-day treatment failure, defined by hospitalization or rescue intervention. We studied 2206 patients, 68% male, with a mean age of 49 years. Severe pain was 52.0% sensitive and 45.3% specific for larger stones &gt;5mm.

Ortvale Klde rockshelter (Republic of Georgia) contains the most detailed LMP-EUP archaeological sequence in the Caucasus, an environmentally and topographically diverse region situated between southwest Asia and Europe. Tephrochronological investigations at the site reveal volcanic ash (tephra) from various volcanic sources and provide a tephrostratigraphy for the site that will facilitate future correlations in the region. We correlate one of the cryptotephra layers to the large, caldera-forming Nemrut Formation eruption (30,000 years ago) from Nemrut volcano in Turkey.

A total of 135 children and adolescents, aged from 1 to 18 years treated by ESWL at IZMIRLIAN Medical Center from 2005 to 2016 were enrolled in this study. Number, size and location of stones were evaluated. A total of 153 ESWL sessions were performed, including two sessions in 9 cases, three sessions in 1 case, and four sessions in 2 cases. Intra- and posttreatment stone fragmentation rate, number of ESWL sessions, shock-wave pulses per session, stone-free rate, and number of ancillary procedures depending on the stone location and size as well as radiation exposure were evaluated. Follow-up observation was performed after 14, 30 and 90 days. In most cases, there was a good stone fragmentation after ESWL. From 200 to 3000 low-energy pulses with a frequency 1-2 Hz and power of 30-50 units on Modulith SLK scale were delivered. Number of shock-wave pulses up to 1000, 2000 and 3000 was sufficient in 18.3%, 51.9% and 26.8% cases, respectively. SFR in children aged 1-5 years was 95.2%, compared to 100%, 100% and 83.7% in patients in the 6-10, 11-15 and 16-18 year age groups, respectively. Complete stone clearance was achieved in patients of 1-5 and 6-10 years after two weeks. In only one patient in the 11- to 15-year age group, all fragments passed after two weeks, while in 4 adolescents in the 16- 18-year age group SFR was achieved after more than 3 months. In addition, in other 3 patients in this age group ESWL was unsuccessful. Our results suggest high efficiency of ESWL under ultrasound guidance in children and adolescents. Absence of X-ray exposure, minimal complication rate, non-invasiveness and high efficiency allow to consider ESWL as a method of choice for the treatment of urolithiasis in children and adolescents.",,32897020,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:39:46.049575-04:00,No,,

Alongside changing patterns of raw material use and decreasing artefact sizes, changes in artefact types are commonly employed to differentiate Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA) assemblages. The current paper employs a quantitative analytical framework based upon the use of neural networks to examine changing constellations of technologies between MSA and LSA assemblages from eastern Africa. Network ensembles were trained to differentiate LSA assemblages from Marine Isotope Stage 3&amp;4 MSA and Marine Isotope Stage 5 MSA assemblages based upon the presence or absence of 16 technologies. Simulations were used to extract significant indicator and contra-indicator technologies for each assemblage class. The trained network ensembles classified over 94% of assemblages correctly, and identified 7 key technologies that significantly distinguish between assemblage classes.

Under rapid environmental change, phenotypic plasticity, if adaptive, could increase the odds for organisms to persist. However, little is known on how environmental variation has shaped plasticity across species ranges over time. Here, we assess whether the portion of phenotypic variation of tree populations linked to the environment is related to the inter-annual climate variability of the last century and how it varies among populations across species ranges and age. To this aim, we used 372,647 individual tree height measurements of three pine species found in low elevation forests in Europe: Pinus nigra Arnold, P. pinaster Aiton and P. pinea L. Measurements were taken in a network of 38 common gardens established in Europe and North Africa with 315 populations covering the distribution range of the species. We fitted linear mixed-effect models of tree height as a function of age, population, climate and competition effects. Models allowed us to estimate tree height response curves at the population level and indexes of populations' phenotypic variation, as a proxy of phenotypic plasticity, at 4, 8 and 16&#x202f;years old, and relate these indexes to the inter-annual climate variability of the last century. We found that phenotypic variation in tree height was higher in young trees than in older ones. We also found that P. pinea showed the highest phenotypic variation in tree height compared with P. pinaster and P. nigra. Finally, phenotypic variation in tree height may be partly adaptive, and differently across species, as climate variability during the last century at the origin of the populations explained between 51 and 69% of the current phenotypic variation of P. nigra and P. pinea, almost twice of the levels of P. pinaster. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Populations' phenotypic variation in tree height is largely explained by the climate variability that the populations experienced during the last century, which we attribute to the genetic diversity among populations.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141454,32814202,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:24:57.697270-04:00,No,,

In Malawi, exclusive breastfeeding has been declining from 72% (2009), 70.2% (2014) and 61% in the most recent survey (2015-16). We aimed to determine factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding in Malawi. We used data from the Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) 2015-2016. Survey records for 2059 mothers of children aged 6&#x2009;months and below were identified and potential factors influencing infant feeding were examined. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to model determinants of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). EBF declined in proportion to the age of the infant. Significant associations with continuing EBF were age of the mother, ethnicity of the mother, sex of infant and number of siblings. Members of the Tumbuka (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.71, CI. 1.13-2.59) and Ngoni (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.05, CI. 1.38-3.05) communities were more likely to practice EBF.

We identify important variations in EBF practices among population sub-groups in Malawi that need to be considered when framing health education messaging. Work is needed to assess the impact of more targeted messaging, whether delivered via 'ten steps' to successful breastfeeding under Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) programming or other health education and awareness campaigns to sensitize communities on implications of some cultural practices on the lives of babies.

Therefore, recognition of high-risk individuals is essential. We aimed to determine the rate and identify risk factors for postpartum seizure/epilepsy readmissions. In this retrospective cohort study, the Nationwide Readmissions Database was used to identify index admissions for delivery and readmissions for seizures in the year 2013, defined by International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for epilepsy, convulsions, and eclampsia in the primary diagnostic position. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine 30-day readmission for seizures as well as associations between demographic, medical, psychiatric, and pregnancy-related factors. There were 1&#xa0;633&#xa0;714 index admissions for delivery, with a 30-day readmission rate for seizures/epilepsy of 19.69 per 100&#xa0;000 index admissions. The mean age of index participants was 28.6 years (SD = 5.8). Postpartum 30-day readmissions for eclampsia represented 80% of seizure/epilepsy readmissions. Higher income was associated with lower odds of seizure/epilepsy readmission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.34-0.72, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.03) for the highest income group.

Readmissions for seizures are fortunately rare, but are important to minimize given morbidity and mortality. Most seizure readmissions occurring within 30&#xa0;days postpartum were coded as eclampsia rather than convulsions or pre-existing epilepsy. These findings suggest that early identification of women with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia may play a role in the prevention of postpartum seizures.

Our objective was to describe the cost to Medicare for aneurysm treatment (EVR plus reinterventions) among a cohort of patients with known follow-up for 5&#xa0;years after repair. We identified patients who underwent EVR within the Vascular Quality Initiative who were linked to their respective Medicare claims file (n&#xa0;= 13,995). We excluded patients who underwent EVR after September 30, 2010, and those who had incomplete Medicare coverage (n&#xa0;= 12,788). The remaining cohort (n&#xa0;= 1207) had complete follow-up until death or 5&#xa0;years (Medicare data available through September 30, 2015). We then obtained and compiled the corresponding Medicare reimbursement data for the index EVR hospitalization and all subsequent reinterventions. We studied 1207 Medicare patients who underwent EVR and had known follow-up for reinterventions for 5&#xa0;years. The mean age was 76.2&#xa0;years (&#xb1;7.1&#xa0;years), 21.6% of patients were female, and 91.1% of procedures were elective. The Kaplan-Meier reintervention rate at 5&#xa0;years was 18%. Among patients who underwent reintervention, 154 (73.7%) had a single reintervention, 40 (19.1%) had two reinterventions, and 15 (7.2%) had three or more reinterventions.

The median cost for subsequent reinterventions was $22,165 (interquartile range, $17,152-$29,605). The cumulative cost to Medicare of aneurysm treatment (EVR plus reinterventions) increased in a stepwise fashion among patients who underwent multiple reinterventions, with each reintervention being similar in cost to the index EVR. The overall cost incurred by Medicare to reimburse for each reintervention after EVR is roughly the same as for the initial procedure itself, meaning that Medicare cost projections would be greater than $100,000 for any individual who undergoes an EVR with three reinterventions. The long-term financial impact of EVR must be considered by surgeons, patients, and healthcare systems alike as these cumulative costs may hinder the fiscal&#xa0;viability of an EVR-first therapeutic approach and highlight the need for judicious patient selection paradigms.",10.1016/j.jvs.2020.06.109,32682064,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 17:54:08.432116-04:00,No,,

The proportion of patients developing gallstones within 12 months after gastrectomy was 8 of 151 (5.3%) in the 300-mg group, 7 of 164 (4.3%) in the 600-mg group, and 25 of 150 (16.7%) in the placebo group. Compared with the placebo group, odds ratios for gallstone formation were 0.27 (95% CI, 0.12-0.62; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.002) in the 300-mg group and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.08-0.50; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) in the 600-mg group. No significant adverse drug reactions were detected among the enrolled patients. Administration of UDCA for 12 months significantly reduced the incidence of gallstones after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. These findings suggest that UDCA administration prevents gallstone formation after gastrectomy in patients with gastric cancer.

Both age and gender have been found to have an impact on KSD, but their influence on the relationship between KSD and increased arterial stiffness is unclear. This study included 6694 subjects from October 2006 to August 2009. The diagnosis of kidney stone was based on the results of ultrasonographic examination. Increased arterial stiffness was defined as right-sided brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) &#x2265; 14 m/s. Associations between KSD and increased arterial stiffness were analyzed using multiple logistic regression models. KSD was positively related to increased arterial stiffness in both male and female groups (males: odds ratio [OR], 1.306; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.035-1.649; females: OR, 1.585; 95% CI, 1.038-2.419) after adjusting for confounding factors.

The site not only contains one of the earliest instances of ornamental freshwater shell and ostrich eggshell beads in the region, but also stone artifacts with features arguably resembling the Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP) blade technology found farther north. The appearance of these innovative archaeological forms have been attributed to the arrival of hominin populations, possibly modern humans, into the region during Marine Isotope Stage 3. Yet, the chronology of the site remains debated due to ambiguities in the existing dates. In this study, we conduct a systematical radiocarbon analysis of charcoal and ostrich eggshell samples obtained throughout the site sequence. Both acid-base-acid and the more stringent acid-base-oxidation pretreatment methods were applied to the charcoal samples. The resulting ages follow an age-depth relationship that is consistent with the stratigraphic profile. In line with previous stratigraphic assessments, Bayesian age modeling suggests that site formation history can be split into two phases: an early phase 43-35 cal kBP associated with a lacustrine depositional environment, and a later phase 35-28 cal kBP associated with rapid terrestrial silt accumulation. The chronology of the archaeological layers containing IUP-like artifacts are placed at 43-39 cal kBP and 35-34 cal kBP respectively. This finding supports the interpretation that an IUP-like blade technology appeared in the SDG region by at least ~41 ka.",10.1371/journal.pone.0232682,32459803,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:41:17.376248-04:00,No,,

Our research provides a detailed technological study of the lithic assemblage of stratigraphic unit 5-6c of the site, using the cha&#xee;ne op&#xe9;ratoire approach, to characterize the technological behavior of the early H.&#xa0;sapiens. Our results indicate that both Levallois and laminar volumetric concepts were used. The Levallois reduction strategy involved preparing subtriangular cores with steep distal edges that allowed producing a series of triangular/subtriangular Levallois blanks using a unidirectional convergent method. Laminar d&#xe9;bitage constitutes a semirotating/rotating method. The results of our study and comparisons with other Levantine sites indicate that the EMP represents a distinct entity within the Levantine Middle Pleistocene record that can be distinguished by the earliest occurrence of a full-fledged Levallois technology in the region, laminar technology, and a distinct tool kit dominated by elongated retouched points. The level of core management involved in producing convergent Levallois products and in preparing laminar cores points to a major conceptual change from the preceding Acheulian and Acheulo-Yabrudian. This suggests a break in knapping strategies between the Lower and the Middle Paleolithic. The finding of a H.&#xa0;sapiens maxilla at Misliya Cave in association with the EMP industry supports the hypothesis that the introduction of the Levallois technology in the Near East was associated with an early dispersal of H.&#xa0;sapiens from Africa.

The goal of this study was to identify risk factors for recurrent KSD despite successful parathyroidectomy in known stone formers with PHPT. We conducted a single-center retrospective review of patients presenting to urology clinic with KSD between January 2008 and July 2018, who were diagnosed with concurrent PHPT, and underwent definitive parathyroidectomy. Laboratory testing for serum calcium, PTH (parathyroid hormone), phosphorus and 25-OH-vitamin D, and 24-hour urine studies for volume, pH, calcium, citrate, oxalate, uric acid, sodium, and creatinine was performed pre- and post-parathyroidectomy. Stone recurrence was determined on routine diagnostic imaging or by symptomatic KSD. Mean age at parathyroidectomy was 57 &#xb1; 14 years. Pre-parathyroidectomy, mean serum calcium, 24-hour urine calcium, and PTH were 10.6 &#xb1; 0.5 mg/dL, 378 &#xb1; 209 mg/day, and 114 &#xb1; 97 pg/mL, respectively. Twenty-six of 69 patients (38%) had multigland parathyroid disease. After parathyroidectomy, serum calcium and PTH levels normalized in 69 of 69 and 62 of 69 patients, respectively.

In a logistic regression model, younger age remains a strong predictive factor for recurrent KSD. Nearly one-quarter of PHPT patients with KSD who undergo successful parathyroidectomy present with recurrent KSD despite normalization of serum calcium, and more than half exhibit persistent calciuria. These patients were younger and may require closer monitoring for stone recurrence after successful parathyroidectomy.

We tested whether sleep apnea-specific hypoxic burden (SASHB) predicts incident HF in two independent cohort studies. In comparison with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), how does sleep apnea-specific hypoxic burden predict incident HF? The samples were derived from two cohort studies: The Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), which included 4,881 middle-aged and older adults (54.4%&#xa0;women), age 63.6 &#xb1; 11.1 years; and the Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men (MrOS), which included 2,653 men, age 76.2 &#xb1; 5.4 years. We computed SASHB as the sleep apnea-specific area under the desaturation curve from pre-event baseline. We used Cox models for incident HF to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for natural log-transformed SASHB and AHI adjusting for multiple confounders. The SASHB predicted incident HF in men in both cohorts, whereas AHI did not. Men in SHHS and MrOS had adjusted HRs (per 1SD increase in SASHB) of 1.18 (95%&#xa0;CI, 1.02-1.37) and 1.22 (95%&#xa0;CI, 1.02-1.45), respectively.

At times predators or competitors for resources and shelters, anthropogenic traces of their exploitation, often for non-nutritional purposes, permeate the archaeological record. Scarce but spectacular depictions in Palaeolithic art confirm peoples' fascination with carnivores. In contrast with the European record, research on hominin/carnivore interactions in Africa has primarily revolved around the hunting or scavenging debate amongst early hominins. As such, the available information on the role of carnivores in Anatomically Modern Humans' economic and cultural systems is limited. Here, we illustrate a particular relationship between humans and carnivores during the MIS5-4 Still Bay and Howiesons Poort techno-complexes at Diepkloof Rock Shelter, South Africa. The recovery of numerous felid remains, including cut-marked phalanges, tarsals and metapodials, constitutes direct evidence for carnivore skinning and, presumably, pelt use in the southern African Middle Stone Age. Carnivore exploitation at the site seems to have focused specifically on nocturnal, solitary and dangerous felines.

Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy is a new technology that uses targeted, controlled water vapour energy (steam) to create necrotic tissue in the prostate. To assess the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American and the Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings published up to 18 February 2020, with no restriction on the language or status of publication. We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, and non-randomised observational prospective studies with concurrent comparison groups, in which men with BPH underwent convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy, another active therapy, or a sham procedure. Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We had planned to perform statistical analyses using a random-effects model, and interpret them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach. We included a&#xa0;single, industry-sponsored RCT, with 197 randomised men, that compared convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy to a sham procedure. The mean age 62.9 years, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 21.97, and the mean prostate volume was 45.4 mL. We only found short-term data, measured up to three months. Primary outcomes Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may improve urologic symptom scores more than a sham procedure, measured on a IPSS&#xa0;scale (0 to 35; higher score represents worse urological symptoms) by a mean difference (MD) of -6.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.06 to -4.74; 195 men; low-certainty evidence), and likely improves quality of life (QoL), measured on a IPSS-QoL scale (0 to 6; higher score represents worse QoL), by a MD of -1.2 (95% CI -1.66 to -0.74; 195 men; moderate-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on major adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 6.79, 95% CI 0.39 to 117.00; 197 men; very low-certainty evidence) assessed by the Clavien-Dindo classification system of III, IV, and V complications. Secondary outcomes We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on retreatment (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 32.86; 197 men; very low-certainty evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may have little to no effect on erectile function (MD 0.4, 95% CI -1.91 to 2.71; 130 men; low-certainty evidence) and ejaculatory function (MD 0.5, 95% CI -0.83 to 1.83; 130 men; low-certainty evidence). Convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy may increase minor adverse events assessed by the Clavien-Dindo classification system of Grade I and II complications (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.11; 197 men; low-certainty evidence). This would correspond to 434 minor adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 264 more to 714 more). We are very uncertain about the effects of convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy on acute urinary retention (RR 4.98, 95% CI 0.28 to 86.63; 197 men; very low-certainty evidence).

We found no evidence for other comparisons, such as convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy versus TURP or other minimal invasive procedures. Compared to a sham procedure, urologic symptom scores and quality of life appear to improve with convective radiofrequency water vapour thermal therapy, but we are very uncertain about major adverse events. The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, with study limitations and imprecision being the most common reasons for rating down.

These clusters correspond closely to geographic, historical, and linguistic divisions of France, and contain different proportions of ancestry from Stone and Bronze Age populations. By modeling the relationship between genetics and geography using EEMS, we were able to detect gene flow barriers that are similar across the two cohorts and correspond to major rivers and mountain ranges. Estimations of effective population sizes also revealed very similar patterns in both cohorts with a rapid increase of effective population sizes over the last 150 generations similar to other European countries. A marked bottleneck is also consistently seen in the two datasets starting in the 14<sup>th</sup> century when the Black Death raged in Europe. In conclusion, by performing the first exhaustive study of the genetic structure of France, we fill a gap in genetic studies of Europe that will be useful to medical geneticists, historians, and archeologists.",10.1038/s41431-020-0584-1,32042083,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:39:55.010246-04:00,No,,

One hundred twenty-three patients with primary gout were recruited from a tertiary referral hospital in S&#xe3;o Paulo, Brazil. All patients underwent ultrasonography and had their clinical and laboratory characteristics assessed. One hundred fifteen (93.5%) patients were male, with a mean age of 62.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;9.4&#x2009;years. Twenty-three (18.7%) patients had asymptomatic nephrolithiasis (detected only by ultrasonography), 7 (6.0%) had symptomatic nephrolithiasis (detected by ultrasonography and a positive clinical history), and 13 (10.0%) had a history of kidney stones, but ultrasonography at evaluation did not show nephrolithiasis. Therefore, 35.0% of the patients had nephrolithiasis (detected either by ultrasonography and/or a positive clinical history). Nephrolithiasis was associated with male gender (43 [100%] vs 72 [90%], p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.049), the use of potassium citrate (13 [30.2%] vs 0, p&#xa0;&lt;&#x2009;&#xa0;0.001) and the use of medications for diabetes (10 [23.3%] vs 8 [10%], p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.047) and dyslipidemia (15 [34.9%] vs 10 [12.5%], p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.003); benzbromarone had an inverse association with nephrolithiasis (21 [48.8%] vs 55 [68.8%], p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.030). In patients with and without nephrolithiasis, no differences were found in the laboratory and ultrasonography characteristics, including serum uric acid levels, urinary uric acid excretion and urine pH. The prevalence of nephrolithiasis in primary gout was 35.0%, and 18.7% of the patients were asymptomatic. Nephrolithiasis was associated with male gender, diabetes and dyslipidemia.

We examined the impact of NA on patient outcomes in an institution with an established rapid recovery protocol. This is a single-institution retrospective analysis of 5914 consecutive primary TJA performed from July 2015 to June 2018. Univariate tests and multivariate regression compared length of stay (LOS), transfusion rates, hematocrit levels, discharge disposition, and emergency room returns between patients receiving GA and NA. Patients receiving NA had a significantly shorter LOS (total hip arthroplasty [THA]: GA 1.74 vs NA 1.36 days, P &lt; .001; total knee arthroplasty [TKA]: GA 1.77 vs NA 1.64 days, P &lt; .001). Both THA and TKA patients receiving NA were less likely to require transfusion (THA: GA 5.8% vs NA 1.6%, P &lt; .001; TKA: GA&#xa0;2.5% vs NA 0.5%, P &lt; .001) and had a higher postoperative hematocrit (THA: GA 32.50% vs NA 33.22%, P&#xa0;&lt; .001; TKA GA 33.57 vs NA 34.50%, P &lt; .001). Patients receiving NA were more likely to discharge home (THA: GA 83.4% vs NA 92.3%, P &lt; .001; TKA: GA 83.3% vs NA 86.3%, P = .010) (THA: NA adjusted OR [aOR] 2.04, P &lt; .001; TKA: NA aOR 1.23, P = .048) and had significantly lower rates of 90-day emergency room visits (THA: NA aOR 0.61, P = .005; TKA: NA aOR 0.74, P = .034). NA appears to contribute to decreased LOS, short-term complications, and transfusions while facilitating home discharge following TKA and THA.

The aim of this study was to examine outcomes of kidney transplantation in APRT deficiency patients. Included were 13 patients in the APRT Deficiency Registry of the Rare Kidney Stone Consortium, 2 from Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia, and 2 from Necker Hospital in Paris, France. The CKD-EPI and CKiD equations were used to calculate glomerular filtration rate estimates. Allograft survival was analyzed employing the Kaplan-Meier method. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to compare alllograft outcomes according to xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) inhibitor treatment status at transplantation. Seventeen patients (9 females) received 22 kidney transplants. Age at first transplantation was 47.2 (14.9-67.0) years. Ten patients received XOR inhibitor therapy pretransplant (11 allografts), while 8 patients did not receive such treatment before transplantation (11 allografts). Two-year allograft survival was 91% and 55% in the 2 groups, respectively (P = 0.16). The median (range) estimated glomerular filtration rate at 2 years posttransplant was 61.3 (24.0-90.0) mL/min/1.73 m when XOR inhibitor therapy was initiated before transplantation, and 16.2 (10.0-39.0) mL/min/1.73 m (P = 0.009) when such treatment was not administered pretransplant. Kidney allograft outcomes are good in APRT deficiency patients beginning XOR inhibitor therapy pretransplant. Delay in such treatment is a major cause of premature graft loss in these patients.

Modeling of the cochlear response to these stimuli demonstrated an imprecision in the location of the spectrotemporal energy, giving rise to uncertainty as to what and when of a stimulus caused any evoked electrophysiological response. This article reports the development and assessment of four short-duration, limited-bandwidth stimuli centered at low, mid, mid-high, and high frequencies, suitable for free-field delivery and, in addition, reproduction via hearing aids. The durations were determined by the British Society of Audiology recommended procedure for measuring Cortical Auditory-Evoked Potentials. The levels and bandwidths were chosen via a computational model to produce uniform cochlear excitation over a width exceeding that likely in a worst-case hearing-impaired listener. These parameters produce robustness against errors in insertion gains, and variation in frequency responses, due to transducer imperfections, room modes, and age-related variation in meatal resonances. The parameter choice predicts large spectral separation between adjacent stimuli on the cochlea. Analysis of the signals processed by examples of recent digital hearing aids mostly show similar levels of gain applied to each stimulus, independent of whether the stimulus was presented in isolation, bursts, continuous, or embedded in continuous speech. These stimuli seem to be suitable for measuring hearing-aided Cortical Auditory-Evoked Potentials and have the potential to be of benefit in the clinical setting.",10.1177/2331216519885568,31858885,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:22:12.561611-04:00,No,,

Higher personal stigma was also significantly correlated with being male, unemployed and good family function. Concerningly high levels of stigmatizing beliefs towards depression were prevalent among the public. This may be a reason why people with mental disorders do not seek assistance.

We explored sex differences in treatment modality by arterial segment (iliac, femoropopliteal, and tibial) with multivariable logistic regression. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariable Cox regression to study sex differences in arterial reintervention and occlusion. In this cohort, patients (n=58&#xa0;247, mean age 68&#xa0;years, 41% women,) had 106&#xa0;073 arteries treated (median=2 arteries, interquartile range=1-3).

PPV infection levels and associated disease symptoms can vary greatly, depending upon the virus strain, host species, or cultivar as well as developmental age of the infected tissues. For example, peaches often exhibit mild symptoms in leaves and fruit while European plums typically display severe chlorotic rings. Systemic virus spread into all host tissues occurs via the phloem, a process that is poorly understood in perennial plant species that undergo a period of dormancy and must annually renew phloem tissues. Currently, little is known about how phloem tissues respond to virus infection. Here, we used translating ribosome affinity purification followed by RNA sequencing to identify phloem- and nonphloem-specific gene responses to PPV infection during leaf development in European plum (<i>Prunus domestica</i> L.). Results showed that, during secondary leaf morphogenesis (4- and 6-week-old leaves), the phloem had a disproportionate response to PPV infection with two- to sixfold more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in phloem than nonphloem tissues, despite similar levels of viral transcripts. In contrast, in mature 12-week-old leaves, virus transcript levels dropped significantly in phloem tissues but not in nonphloem tissues. This drop in virus transcripts correlated with an 18-fold drop in phloem-specific DEGs. Furthermore, genes associated with defense responses including RNA silencing were spatially coordinated in response to PPV accumulation and were specifically induced in phloem tissues at 4 to 6 weeks. Combined, these findings highlight the temporal and spatial dynamics of leaf tissue responses to virus infection and reveal the importance of phloem responses within a perennial host.",10.1094/MPMI-06-19-0152-FI,31347973,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:15:50.946866-04:00,No,,

There are some concerns about the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) because of potential fetal exposure to radiation and serious adverse events, such as post-ERCP pancreatitis, which increases fetal or maternal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ERCP during pregnancy and to present our experience. This study included 25 pregnant patients who underwent ERCP due to biliopancreatic pathologies between 2010 and 2017. Indications for ERCP were choledocholithiasis (n=12), biliary pancreatitis (n=9), and acute cholangitis (n=4). ERCP procedures were performed using fluoroscopy (n=18) and the non-radiation technique (n=7). The duration of fluoroscopy was recorded in all cases. Fetal and maternal complications were both assessed. The mean age of patients was 29.4 (range, 21-40) years, and the mean duration of pregnancy was 19.9 weeks. All the 25 ERCP procedures were performed successfully. Biliary sphincterotomy was performed in all patients, and 18 patients with choledocholithiasis underwent stone extraction. The average procedure duration was 11 min, and the average duration of fluoroscopy was 6 s. There were no major complications in any patient. After the deliveries, the newborns were apparently healthy during the follow-up period of 1-7 years. Either conventional or non-radiation ERCP procedures can be performed successfully in pregnancy, with no increase in the number of feto-maternal complications when performed by experienced endoscopists.",10.5152/tjg.2019.18799,31258133,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:50:27.503529-04:00,No,,

In the recent study, we decided to evaluate hypercalciuria in children receiving cefotaxime. This case-control study was conducted in Amirkabir hospital (Arak, Iran), where 30 children received intravenous cefotaxime were placed in the case group and 30 children without intravenous administration of cefotaxime were included in the control group. The ratio of calcium to creatinine was measured in both groups. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 23.

COM and COD form in differing urinary environments, which suggest differential underlying metabolic abnormalities associated with each subtype. We compared clinical and metabolic findings in CaOx stone formers to delineate factors differentiating COD and COM stone formers and the implication this holds in terms of etiology and treatment. <b><i>Patients and Methods:</i></b> We identified CaOx stone formers that had passed their stones or had undergone endoscopic extraction between October 2014 and December 2018. Only patients who had a predominant subtype (&#x2265;80% COM or COD) and who had a 24-hour urine evaluation before medical management were included. Clinical and metabolic factors were compared in the two subgroups. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Out of 157 stone formers, 121 were COM and 36 were COD.

It uses a reduced trocar caliber in an otherwise standard four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and seeks to achieve """"scarless"""" surgery without compromising patient safety. Between May 2016 and November 2017, 29 patients underwent elective NC at the Department of General Surgery of Sant'Andrea Hospital (La Spezia, Italy). Inclusion criteria were female sex, age between 18 and 45 years, good performance status (ASA 1-2) and BMI lower than 25. Twenty-one patients underwent a standard 4-port technique: 12mm port in the supraumbilical area, 5mm port in the subxiphoid position, 3mm port in the mid-epigastric area and another 3 mm port in the right mid-clavicular position. In 8 patients, 3mm ports were replaced by 2mm angiocath. A Critical View of Safety (CVS) was achieved in all procedures. Intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) via the cystic duct before any transection of the structures was routinely performed in selected cases, such as those with an unclear biliary anatomy or risk factors for main-duct stones. In our institution, laparoscopic transcystic common bile duct (CBD) exploration is routinely performed in CBD lithiasis. The mean operative time was 66.79 min (range 25-120 min). IOC was performed in 12 patients (41.4%) with suspected choledocolythiasis. There was no conversion to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy or open cholecystectomy. The mean hospital stay was 1.48 days (1-7 days). A Clavien-Dindo IIIB complication occurred in one patient on the third postoperative day. The mean VAS pain score was 3 (0-7). Closure of the skin with primary intention was achieved in all patients. Mean return to work was 6.76 days (3-15 days) and the mean return to previous physical activity was 12.17 days (4-30 days). All of the patients completed the Scar Satisfaction Questionnaire: 26 (89.7% ) and 3 patients (10.3%) were very satisfied and satisfied, respectively. Any effort to reduce invasiveness and improve cosmesis must not jeopardize safety. Our case series demonstrates that needlescopy can be safely associated with intraoperative cholangiography to recognize CBD stones. This technique offers the advantage of minor postoperative pain, better cosmesis results, early return to routine life activities and great satisfaction for the patient. Needlescopy is a valuable and safe alternative that is suitable for elective cholecystectomy in properly selected patients, such as young female patients.""",,31037715,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:43:49.228307-04:00,No,,

Mostly, desert conditions prevailed during the interpluvial periods, which were only periodically interrupted by enhanced precipitation during pluvial or interglacial periods. Responding to Quaternary climatic changes, hominin dispersal was channeled through vegetated corridors. This manuscript introduces a recently discovered group of Acheulean and Middle Stone Age sites far from the Nile Valley in the Eastern Desert (Sudan), referred to as Eastern Desert Atbara River (EDAR). The &#x223c;5 m stratigraphy of the area is divided into three units (Units I-III) bounded by erosion surfaces. Each contains archaeological horizons. The EDAR area has rich surface sites with Acheulean horizons under the surface, singular finds of hand-axes within stratigraphic context in exposures, and large Acheulean sites partly exposed and destroyed by the gold mining activity. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of Acheulean and MSA horizons from the EDAR 135 site indicates that the sedimentary deposits with stone artifacts were formed during the Middle Pleistocene between Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 7 (pluvial) and 6 (interpluvial). Based on the OSL dating from the top of Unit IB, Acheulean artifact-bearing sedimentary deposits from overlying Unit IIA are younger than ca. 231 ka. Unit IA is the oldest Acheulean horizon in the EDAR area, not yet dated but definitively older than ca. 231 ka. An MSA horizon found in fluvial sediment was dated to be between 156 and 181 ka by OSL. The EDAR Pleistocene archaeological sites provide evidence for the presence of additional corridor(s) across Nubia, which connects the early hominin dispersals from the Nile and Atbara River systems to the Red Sea coast.",10.1016/j.jhevol.2019.01.004,31010540,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:42:09.628427-04:00,No,,

A retrospective cohort study (2012-2016) was conducted in all HIV-infected patients seen in a federally qualified community health center in Houston, Texas. CKD prevalence and its association with HIV viral load and CD4 count were determined. The association of the change in eGFR over time and comorbidities was assessed using linear mixed models. Of 3714 HIV-infected patients analyzed, 153 (4.1%) had CKD. The prevalence of CKD in the different racial groups was 5.4% White, 4.0% African American, 2.8% Hispanic/Latino and 3.2% Asian. There was no difference in the rate of decline in kidney function in White vs. African American HIV infected patients with CKD. Compared with non-CKD patients, CKD patients were older, had lived longer with HIV infection, had lower CD4 cell counts, higher proportions of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebrovascular disease, and had significantly higher rates of eGFR deterioration represented by a median decrease of 26.5% from first to last follow-up eGFR (versus 0% change). Linear mixed modeling identified older age, male gender, White race, longer time with HIV infection, hypertension, history of kidney stones, cerebrovascular disease, autoimmune disease, increased potassium and total cholesterol levels, and being treated with combination ART as associated with a worsening eGFR over time. This study demonstrates a prevalence of CKD in HIV-infected patients of 4.1% and points to an important role for HIV medications and other common comorbidities in the genesis and progression of kidney disease. Importantly, CKD was not more prevalent in African Americans than in Whites, perhaps due to a low prevalence of IV drug abuse as inferred from the lower prevalence of HCV infection in this cohort.",10.1371/journal.pone.0215575,30995263,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:21:50.074793-04:00,No,,

The risk of organic erectile dysfunction was higher in the gallbladder stone disease cohort than the nongallbladder stone disease cohort (4.01 vs. 2.69 per 1,000 person-years, adjusted hazard ratio = 1.41, 97.5% confidence interval [1.12, 1.78]), but the risk of psychogenic erectile dysfunction was comparable between the gallbladder stone disease cohort and the nongallbladder stone disease cohort (0.40 vs. 0.28 per 1,000 person-years, adjusted hazard ratio = 1.37, 97.5% confidence interval [0.67, 2.79]). Moreover, gallbladder stone disease men with cholecystectomy exhibited a lower risk of developing organic erectile dysfunction than gallbladder stone disease men without cholecystectomy (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.58, 97.5% confidence interval [0.41, 0.80]). The risk of organic erectile dysfunction contributed by gallbladder stone disease was only significantly higher in men aged &#x2265;65 years (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.21, 97.5% confidence interval [1.34, 3.63]) and in men with comorbidities (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.42, 97.5% confidence interval [1.09, 1.85]). The risk of psychogenic erectile dysfunction contributed by gallbladder stone disease was nonsignificant in each age group and in men with or without comorbidities. Gallbladder stone disease is associated with an increased risk of organic erectile dysfunction, but it has no association with psychogenic erectile dysfunction. History of cholecystectomy for gallbladder stone disease may ameliorate the risk of organic erectile dysfunction; it requires more studies to ascertain the protective mechanism and to clarify whether the existence of gallbladder stone disease is an epiphenomenon or independent risk factor of erectile dysfunction.",10.1177/1557988319839589,30907203,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:21:05.655779-04:00,No,,

We investigated the pathogenesis of <i>MYOC</i> glaucoma by examining a donor eye from a patient with JOAG caused by a Tyr437His <i>MYOC</i> mutation. Case-control, immunohistochemical study of a donor eye from a patient with JOAG caused by a Tyr437His <i>MYOC</i> mutation and age-matched control donor eyes. An eye from a 59-year-old male with JOAG caused by a Tyr437His <i>MYOC</i> mutation and eyes from five donors (ages 51-66) with no known ocular disease were examined. Frozen fixed sections of the iridocorneal angle were prepared from the donor eyes of the <i>MYOC</i> glaucoma patient and control eyes.

All surgeons had prior experience performing SLN mapping for endometrial cancer using other methods. The rate of empty packet dissections and SLN counts were evaluated using a logistic regression model analysis. In total, 236 patients undergoing SLN mapping for either endometrial cancer (85%) or complex atypical hyperplasia (15%) were identified from a prospectively maintained database. When examining all six surgeons together, the percentage of empty packet dissections decreased with increasing number of procedures performed. Each additional procedure was associated with a 3.6% reduction in the odds of an empty packet SLN dissection. After adjusting for individual surgeons, each additional procedure was associated with a 4.9% reduction in the odds of an empty packet.

Nestled between the Pamir and Alay ranges at a baseline elevation of nearly 3000m, Kyrgyzstan's high Alay Valley forms a wide geographic corridor that comprised one of the primary channels of the ancient Silk Road. Recent archaeological survey reveals a millennia-long history of pastoral occupation of Alay from the early Bronze Age through the Medieval period, and a stratified Holocene sequence at the site of Chegirtke Cave. Faunal remains were recovered from test excavations as well as surface collection of material from recent marmot activity. Although recovered specimens were highly fragmented and mostly unidentifiable using traditional zooarchaeological methods, species identification via collagen mass fingerprinting (ZooMS) coupled with sex and first-generation hybrid identification through ancient DNA enabled preliminary characterization of the animal economy of Alay herders. Our new results indicate primary reliance on sheep at Chegirtke Cave (ca. 2200 BCE), with cattle and goat also present. The discovery of a large grinding stone at a spatially associated Bronze or Iron Age habitation structure suggests a mixed agropastoral economic strategy, rather than a unique reliance on domestic animals. Radiocarbon-dated faunal assemblages from habitation structures at nearby localities in the Alay Valley demonstrate the presence of domestic horse, as well as Bactrian camel during later periods. The current study reveals that agropastoral occupation of the high-mountain Alay corridor started millennia before the formal establishment of the Silk Road, and posits that ZooMS, when paired with radiocarbon dates and ancient DNA, is a powerful and cost-effective tool for investigating shifts in the use of animal domesticates in early pastoral economies.",10.1371/journal.pone.0205646,30379865,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:41:06.270730-04:00,No,,

These factors and postoperative SIRS were retrospectively analyzed. There were 108 cases (10.49%) of SIRS among 1030 patients. The results of univariate analysis showed that sex (P=0.015), Staghorn calculi (P&lt;0.001), preoperative urinary culture of Gram-negative bacteria (P&lt;0.001) and preoperative urinary sediment microscopy WBC (+, ++, +++, ++++) (P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.001, P=0.009, P=0.045) were correlated with postoperative SIRS (P&lt;0.05). According to Multivariate analysis results, the likelihood of SIRS after PCNL increased with Staghorn calculi (P=0.01, OR=10.457, 95% CI=1.312-3.092), the urinary sediment microscopy WBC (+&#x223c;++++) (P&lt;0.001, OR=2.591, 95% CI=1.661-4.042) and positive urine culture for Gram-negative bacteria (P&lt;0.001, OR=3.550, 95% CI=2.205-5.715). Staghorn calculi, the urinary sediment microscopy WBC and positive urine culture for Gram-negative bacteria are independent risk factors for SIRS. Patients affected by these risk factors should receive careful anti-infectious perioperative management for prevention of postoperative SIRS. 4.",10.1016/j.purol.2018.06.006,30301521,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:05:03.874410-04:00,No,,

Lack of awareness of emotional difficulties can make self-report unreliable. However, individuals with TBI demonstrate involuntary changes in heart rate variability which may enable objective quantification of emotional dysfunction. Sixteen subjects with chronic TBI and 10 age-matched controls were tested on an emotional function battery during which they watched a series of film clips normed to elicit specific positively and negatively valenced emotions: amusement, sexual amusement, sadness, fear and disgust. Subjective responses to the emotional stimuli were also obtained. Additionally, surface electrodes measured cardiac and respiratory signals to compute heart rate variability (HRV), from which measures of parasympathetic activity, the respiratory frequency area (RFA) and sympathetic activity, the low frequency area (LFA), of the HRV frequency spectrum were derived. The Neurobehavioral Rating Scale-Revised (NRS-R) and the King-Devick (KD) test were administered to assess neurobehavioral dysfunction. The two groups showed no differences in subjective ratings of emotional intensity. Subjects with TBI showed significantly decreased sympathetic activity when viewing amusing stimuli and significantly increased sympathetic activity when viewing sad stimuli compared to controls. Most of the subjects did not show agitation, anxiety, depression, blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, decreased motivation or mental fatiguability on the NRS-R. However, 13/16 subjects with TBI demonstrated attention difficulty on the NRS-R which was positively correlated with the increased sympathetic activity during sad stimuli. Both attention difficulty and abnormal autonomic responses to sad stimuli were correlated with the timing on the KD test, which reflected difficulty with visual attention shifting. The HRV spectrum may be useful to identify subclinical emotional dysfunction in individuals with TBI. Attention difficulites, specifically impairment in visual attention shifting, may contribute to abnormal reactivity to sad stimuli that may be detected and potentially treated to improve emotional function.",10.1080/02699052.2018.1519598,30261156,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:12:24.629330-04:00,No,,

Relatively rare, with an incidence of approximately 1/10,000, the mechanisms underlying AP are not well understood. This study examined otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) to determine if there is evidence of a peripheral (i.e., cochlear) basis for AP. Two OAE types were examined: spontaneous emissions (SOAEs) and stimulus-frequency emissions (SFOAEs). Our motivations to explore a peripheral foundation for AP were several-fold. First is the observation that pitch judgment accuracy has been reported to decrease with age due to age-dependent physiological changes cochlear biomechanics. Second is the notion that SOAEs, which are indirectly related to perception, could act as a fixed frequency reference. Third, SFOAE delays, which have been demonstrated to serve as a proxy measure for cochlear frequency selectivity, could indicate tuning differences between groups. These led us to the hypotheses that AP subjects would (relative to controls) exhibit a. greater SOAE activity and b. sharper cochlear tuning. To test these notions, measurements were made in normal-hearing control (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;33) and AP-possessor (N&#x202f;=&#x202f;20) populations. In short, no substantial difference in SOAE activity was found between groups, indicating no evidence for one or more strong SOAEs that could act as a fixed cue. SFOAE phase-gradient delays, measured at several different probe levels (20-50&#x202f;dB SPL), also showed no significant differences between groups. This observation argues against sharper cochlear frequency selectivity in AP subjects. Taken together, these data support the prevailing view that AP mechanisms predominantly arise at a processing level in the central nervous system (CNS) at the brainstem or higher, not within the cochlea.",10.1016/j.heares.2018.08.001,30190151,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:14:16.827098-04:00,No,,

Here we analyse shotgun metaproteomic data from 100 archaeological dental calculus samples ranging from the Iron Age to the post-medieval period (eighth century BC to nineteenth century AD) in England, as well as 14 dental calculus samples from contemporary dental patients and recently deceased individuals, to characterize the range and extent of dietary proteins preserved in dental calculus. In addition to milk proteins, we detect proteomic evidence of foodstuffs such as cereals and plant products, as well as the digestive enzyme salivary amylase. We discuss the importance of optimized protein extraction methods, data analysis approaches and authentication strategies in the identification of dietary proteins from archaeological dental calculus.

All mice were maintained in sterile housing and provided sterile water and irradiated rodent chow. Approximately 6 wk after implantation, 4 of the 30 mice showed clinical signs of depression and dehydration. The 2 animals most severely affected were euthanized and presented for necropsy. The urinary bladders of these animals were distended with variable sized white, opaque uroliths. Urinalysis revealed coccal bacteria, erythrocytes, neutrophils and struvite crystals. Urine cultures from both necropsied animals grew heavy, pure growths of Staphylococcus xylosus. The organism was sensitive to all antibiotics tested except erythromycin (intermediate).

Archaeological evidence suggests that the Neolithization process may have happened through the adoption of innovations by local Epipaleolithic communities or by demic diffusion from the Eastern Mediterranean shores or Iberia. Here, we present an analysis of individuals' genome sequences from Early and Late Neolithic sites in Morocco and from Early Neolithic individuals from southern Iberia. We show that Early Neolithic Moroccans (&#x223c;5,000 BCE) are similar to Later Stone Age individuals from the same region and possess an endemic element retained in present-day Maghrebi populations, confirming a long-term genetic continuity in the region. This scenario is consistent with Early Neolithic traditions in North Africa deriving from Epipaleolithic communities that adopted certain agricultural techniques from neighboring populations.

During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava (IVC) when a woman lies in the supine position. The azygos system of veins is the dominant pathway of collateral venous return back to the heart in the event of acute obstruction of the IVC. It is suggested that this pathway provides adequate collateral venous circulation in the event of IVC compression in the supine position during late pregnancy. <b>Objective:</b> Investigate the effect of supine positioning on maternal hemodynamics during late pregnancy and the role of collateral venous circulation. <b>Methods:</b> Ethics approval was obtained and 12 women with singleton pregnancies between 35- and 38-week gestation underwent magnetic resonance imaging in the supine and left lateral decubitus positions using a Skyra 3T system (Siemens). Phase-contrast images were evaluated to measure cardiac output, blood flow through the azygos vein, and blood flow through the abdominal aorta (AA) and IVC at two levels: at the level of aortic bifurcation and immediately above the renal veins. <b>Results:</b> The supine position was associated with a 16.4% reduction in cardiac output when compared to the left lateral position. In addition, blood flow through the IVC decreased at its origin by 85.3% and by 44.4% at the level of the renal veins. Blood flow through the azygos vein increased in the supine position by 220%. Blood flow through the AA at the level of the renal veins did not differ significantly; however, it is reduced by 32.3% at the level of the aortic bifurcation. <b>Conclusions:</b> Women in late pregnancy experience an increase in collateral venous blood flow when lying supine, likely as a response to marked compression of the IVC in this position.

The ages of sediments directly overlying the Elsterian till are approximately 400 ka and prove that the first extensive Fennoscandian ice sheet extension during the Quaternary correlates with MIS 12 and not with MIS 10. Furthermore, the 400 ka old fluvial units contain Lower Paleolithic stone artefacts that document the first human appearance in the region.

From January 2016 to December 2016, we analyzed 130 patients who placed a ureteral stent before ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL). A total of 108 patients were enrolled, including 77 (71.3%) men and 31 (28.7%) women, and the mean age was 58.9 &#xb1;14.3 years. On the day before URSL, plain radiography (kidney, ureter, bladder X-ray [KUB]) was used to confirm the stone location and ureteral stent position. According to KUB, we defined the crossing midline group as when the distal loop of the ureteral stent was crossing the bladder midline, and the not crossing midline group as when the distal loop of the ureteral stent was not crossing the bladder midline. We assessed urinary symptoms of the two groups using the overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) on the day before URSL. The crossing midline group had a worse total OABSS (p &lt;0.001) and worse scores for each item of daytime frequency (p = 0.047), nocturia (p &lt;0.001), urgency (p = 0.002), and urgency incontinence (p = 0.045) than did the not crossing group. In multivariate analysis, stent position had the strongest association with the total OABSS (p = 0.002) among the other factors of age, sex, body mass index, stent side, stent diameter, stent length and stent indwelling time.

This is rarely examined empirically. Study aim was to investigate the association between self-reported depression disorder (DD) and symptoms in patients with advanced cancer controlled for prognostic factors. The sample included 935 patients, mean age 62, 52% males, from an international multicentre observational study (European Palliative Care Research Collaborative - Computerised Symptom Assessment and Classification of Pain, Depression and Physical Function). DD was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and scored with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-5 algorithm for major depressive disorder, excluding somatic symptoms. Symptom burden was assessed by summing scores on somatic Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) symptoms, excluding depression, anxiety, and well-being. Item-by-item scores and symptom burden of those with and without DD were compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests. The relative importance of sociodemographic, medical, and prognostic factors and DD in predicting symptom burden was assessed by hierarchical, multiple regression analyses. Patients with DD reported significantly higher scores on ESAS items and a twofold higher symptom burden compared with those without. Factors associated with higher symptom burden were as follows. Diagnosis: lung (&#x3b2; = 0.15, p &lt; 0.001) or breast cancer (&#x3b2; = 0.08, p &lt; 0.05); poorer prognosis: high C-reactive protein (&#x3b2; = 0.08, p &lt; 0.05), lower Karnofsky Performance Status (&#x3b2; = -0.14, p &lt; 0.001), and greater weight loss (&#x3b2; = -0.15, p &lt; 0.001); taking opioids (&#x3b2; = 0.11, p &lt; 0.01); and having DD (&#x3b2; = 0.23, p &lt; 0.001).

Site formation processes are investigated through taphonomic proxies and spatial analysis, and consider artifact features, orientation patterns, and topographic data retrieved during archaeological excavation. This enables an assessment of the impact of natural agents on the assemblage and a discussion of the relevance of water disturbance in shaping the structure of the EF-HR archaeological record. Our results indicate that fluvial action over the assemblage was significant, although it is likely that EF-HR still preserves areas marginally affected by water sorting and rearrangement.

We comparatively assessed the morphology of OH 83 using quantitative and qualitative data from penecontemporaneous fossils and the W.W. Howells modern human craniometric dataset. OH 83 is geologically dated to ca. 60-32 ka. Its morphology is indicative of an early modern human, falling at the low end of the range of variation for post-orbital cranial breadth, the high end of the range for bifrontal breadth, and near average in frontal length. There have been numerous attempts to use cranial anatomy to define the species Homo sapiens and identify it in the fossil record. These efforts have not met wide agreement by the scientific community due, in part, to the mosaic patterns of cranial variation represented by the fossils. The variable, mosaic pattern of trait expression in the crania of Middle and Late Pleistocene fossils implies that morphological modernity did not occur at once. However, OH 83 demonstrates that by ca. 60-32 ka modern humans in Africa included individuals that are at the fairly small and gracile range of modern human cranial variation.",10.1002/ajpa.23292,28786473,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:09:50.457862-04:00,No,,

Change scares us so much that we reflect on our past, the old days, with such reverence that we paint over the ugly parts. However, we still talk about how change is good. Consider our institutionalised method of learning that has existed for centuries and involved people sitting learning from another person in a physical space. Then, suddenly in the last 20 years, there is a complete change and almost every major institution in the United States and many around the world decided to offer a new method of learning. Enter online learning. It becomes a sudden disruption to a traditional system. It is not surprising that there has been resistance from faculty, students and administrators. Even in the face of evidence that online learning works as effectively as traditional onsite learning, still people resist. Oddly enough, the resistance can come from those who base their careers on facts and research, but continue to ignore the evidence. Even performance results get ignored.

To reduce use of CTU in this population, we instigated a new imaging and management guideline in our ED. This was a quasi-experimental prospective study, whereby a new guideline was commenced at the intervention site (Monash Medical Centre) and the existing guideline continued at the control site (Dandenong Hospital). The new guideline promotes focused ultrasound for diagnosing renal colic and restricts CT to those with poor response to analgesia or 'red flags'. A consecutive series of patients with suspected renal colic were prospectively enrolled and outcomes compared between the sites. The primary outcome was CTU utilisation and secondary outcomes were radiation exposure, stone rate on CTU, admission, ED length of stay and rates of urological intervention and returns to ED at 4-week follow-up. Preintervention CTU rates were 76.7% at Monash and 72.1% at Dandenong. 324 patients were enrolled; 148 at Monash and 176 at Dandenong.

It is interesting to note that cutaneous injuries evolved parallel to human society. An essential first step in the pathogenesis of ulcers was represented by the transition of the quadruped man to Homo Erectus. This condition was characterized by a greater gravitational pressure on the lower limbs, with consequences on the peripheral venous system. Furthermore, human evolution was characterized by an increased risk of traumatic injuries, secondary to his natural need to create fire and hunt (e.g. stones, iron, fire, animal fighting). Humans then began to fight one another until they came to real wars, with increased frequency of wounds and infectious complications. The situation degraded with the introduction of horse riding, introduced by the Scites, who first tamed animals in the 7th century BC. This condition exhibited iliac veins at compression phenomena, favouring the venous stasis. With time, man continued to evolve until the modern age, which is characterized by increased risk factors for venous wounds such as poor physical activity and dietary errors (1, 2).",,28702971,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:40:49.505028-04:00,No,,

We consider our findings in the framework of recent models for early human subsistence behavior. In particular, we link our study with models involving resource intensification to examine whether foraging strategies in the HP were more or less intensive than those in the SB. Based on our criteria used to assess intensification-the exploitation of low-ranked prey, the processing of low-utility elements, transport decisions, and occupational intensity-intensive subsistence strategies are more evident at KDS than BBC. Our results suggest that low-ranked elements were processed more heavily and diet breath was broader at KDS than at BBC. However, foraging ranges may have been more extensive at BBC than at KDS. Taphonomic data also suggests that the SB at BBC was a low-intensity, sporadically occupied period in contrast to the high-intensity occupations during the HP at KDS.

Our results identify patterns of continuity in ochre acquisition, treatment and use reflecting both persistent use of the same geological resources and similar uses of iron-rich rocks by late MSA Porc-Epic inhabitants. Considering the large amount of ochre processed at the site, this continuity can be interpreted as the expression of a cohesive cultural adaptation, largely shared by all community members and consistently transmitted through time.

It was detected that only <i>Deuteromycota</i> and <i>Eubacteria</i> colonized all types of surfaces in the samples of bone fragments from the historic burial site (with the age in the range of 90-95 years); with the abundance of micromycetes, the proportion of Eubacteria naturally decreased, while with the increased bacterial background counts the rate of micromycetes detection decreased. The insignificant amount of nutrients in the bony remnants led to the decrease in the number and biological diversity of microorganisms contaminating them; species adapted to a hard-to-reach organic substrate dominated there. During the process of bony remnants decomposition, when the conditions of their location changed, inter-species competition and specific recolonization occurred by species of microorganisms most adapted to a hard-to-reach organic substrate in the abiotic and biotic conditions of existence given.

We observed both increases in richness (10.6&#xa0;%) and abundance (9.5&#xa0;%) of freshwater insects over the past three decades. These changes were related to increases in summer temperature and summer precipitation, which had negative effects on species richness, and to increases in winter temperature and precipitation, which had positive effects. Further we found that increased temperature was generally related to increased abundance, whereas increased precipitation was associated with declines, thus highlighting the particularly varying impacts on differing insect orders. Given that freshwater insects have been more severely affected by global change than marine and terrestrial species, the observed increases are a positive sign, but the overall situation of freshwater invertebrates is still critical.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163017,36963681,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:16:37.690661-04:00,No,,

We synthesize these contributions and propose a novel interpretation, arguing shared trait changes under ancient domestication resulted primarily from shared disruption of wild reproductive regimes. We detail four primary selective pathways for 'reproductive disruption' under domestication and contrast these succinct and demonstrable mechanisms with cryptic genetic associations posited by the NCC hypothesis. In support of our perspective, we illustrate numerous important ways in which NCCs contribute to vertebrate reproductive phenotypes, and argue it is not surprising that features derived from these cells would be coincidentally altered under major selective regime changes, as occur in domestication. We then illustrate several pertinent examples of Darwin's 'unconscious selection' in action, and compare applied selection and phenotypic responses in each case. Lastly, we explore the ramifications of reproductive disruption for wider evolutionary discourse, including links to wild 'self-domestication' and 'island effect', and discuss outstanding questions.",10.1098/rspb.2022.2464,36946116,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 12:59:44.047137-04:00,No,,

This culinary process is linked to key arguments surrounding the evolution of lactase persistence in prehistory. Despite extensive evidence indicating the presence of dairy products in ceramics in the European Neolithic, questions remain about the nature and extent of milk (and lactose) processing and consumption. In order to investigate past patterns of dairy processing, here we analyse ancient proteins identified from Late Neolithic Funnel Beaker ceramics, scrutinizing the principle that curd and whey proteins partition during the production of dairy foods from milk. Our results indicate the presence of casein-rich dairy products in these vessels suggesting the creation of curd-enriched products from raw milk. Moreover, this analysis reveals the use of multiple species for their dairy products in the Late Neolithic, adding to a growing body of evidence for the period. Alongside palaeoproteomic analysis, we applied well-established lipid residue analysis. Differential interpretations between these two approaches show that palaeoproteomics is especially useful where the effects from isotope mixing may underestimate the frequency of dairy products in archaeological ceramics, highlighting the potential utility of a multi-stranded approach to understand life histories of vessel use.",10.1098/rsos.230124,36938542,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 18:06:52.961394-04:00,No,,

Based on the presence of this specimen, an age of &#x223c;4.5&#xa0;Ma was inferred for Waypoint 160, making it far older than other Cradle sites. This biochronological age was used to argue that Parapapio and Cercopithecoides fossils from Waypoint 160 were the oldest in the region. Here, we provide a detailed sedimentological context for the in-situ deposits at Waypoint 160. We have identified interior cave deposits, in contrast to other sites at Bolt's Farm. Petrography confirms that one unit (facies D) contains in-situ microfaunal fossils, indicating the likely provenience of the E.&#xa0;bolti specimen. Palaeomagnetic analysis shows four periods of magnetic polarity in the sequence. Using U-Pb ages as chronological pins, we argue that the upper part of the sequence records a polarity change at the end of the Olduvai subChron (1.78&#xa0;Ma). The lower part of the sequence records a polarity shift from normal to reversed that likely relates to the Feni subChron (2.16-2.12&#xa0;Ma), based on a basal flowstone U-Pb age of 2.269&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.075&#xa0;Ma.

We consider the potential etiologies for the appearance of the skeletal anomalies and lesions. Based on the bioarchaeological context, we propose that a shared epigenetic landscape predisposed the brothers to acquiring an infectious disease and their elite status privileged them enough to endure it. We then contextualize these potential illnesses and disorders with the trephination procedure. The infrequency of trephination in the region indicates that only selected individuals could access such a procedure, and the severity of the pathological lesions suggests the procedure was possibly intended as curative to deteriorating health. Ultimately, both brothers were buried with the same rites as others in their community, thus demonstrating their continued integration in society even after death.",10.1371/journal.pone.0281020,36812179,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:18:20.007627-04:00,No,,

In southern Italy, the association between Homo sapiens fossils and non-Mousterian material culture, as well as the mode and tempo of Neanderthal demise, are still vividly debated. In this research, we focus on the study of two human teeth by using 3D geometric morphometric approaches for a reliable taxonomical attribution as well as obtaining new radiometric dates on the archeological sequence. This work presents two lower deciduous molars uncovered at Roccia San Sebastiano (Mondragone-Caserta, Italy), stratigraphically associated with Mousterian (RSS1) and Uluzzian (RSS2) artifacts. To obtain a probabilistic attribution of the two RSS teeth to each reference taxa group composed of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, we performed and compared the performance of three supervised learning algorithms (flexible discriminant analysis, multiadaptive regression splines, and random forest) on both crown and cervical outlines obtained by virtual morphometric methods. We show that RSS1, whose Mousterian context appears more recent than 44,800-44,230&#x2009;cal BP, can be attributed to a Neanderthal, while RSS2, found in an Uluzzian context that we dated to 42,640-42,380&#x2009;cal BP, is attributed to Homo sapiens. This site yields the most recent direct evidence for a Neanderthal presence in southern Italy and confirms a later shift to upper Paleolithic technology in southwestern Italy compared to the earliest Uluzzian evidence at Grotta del Cavallo (Puglia, Italy).",10.1002/ajpa.24593,36790758,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:19:09.579064-04:00,No,,

Prior research identified a calcified Echinococcus granulosis cyst, which causes hydatid disease. Osteolytic lesions consistent with hydatid disease were also present in this individual and others. Hydatid disease is observed in high frequencies in pastoralists, and its presence in a hunter-gatherer community raises questions regarding human-animal interaction prior to farming. The objective of this article is to identify and describe the epidemiology of hydatid disease in the human skeletal assemblage at Con Co Ngua. One hundred and fifty-five individuals were macroscopically assessed for lesions. Of these, eight individuals were radiographed. Hydatid disease was diagnosed using a new threshold criteria protocol derived from clinical literature, which prioritizes lesions specific to the parasite. Twenty-two individuals (14.2%) presented with osteolytic lesions consistent with hydatid disease, affecting the distal humerus, proximal femur and forearm, and pelvis. Seven individuals radiographed (4.5%) had multilocular cystic lesions strongly diagnostic for hydatid disease. All probable cases had lesions of the distal humerus. The remaining lesions were macroscopically identical to those radiographed and were considered possible cases. While hydatid disease has previously been found in pre-agricultural communities, the high prevalence at Con Co Ngua is non-incidental. We propose that the presence of wild canids and management of wild buffalo and deer increased the risk of disease transmission. These findings further reveal subsistence complexity among hunter-gatherers living millennia prior to the adoption of farming in Southeast Asia.",10.1002/ajpa.24435,36787713,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 01:09:44.925896-04:00,No,,

Different algorithms may be used to apply semilandmarks, but little is known about the consequences of analytical results. Here, we assess how different approaches and semilandmarking densities affect the estimates and visualisations of mean and allometrically scaled surfaces. The performance of three landmark-driven semilandmarking approaches is assessed using two different surface mesh datasets with different degrees of variation and complexity: adult human head and ape cranial surfaces. Surfaces fitted to estimates of the mean and allometrically scaled landmark and semilandmark configurations arising from geometric morphometric analyses of these datasets are compared between semilandmarking approaches and different densities, as well as with those from warping to landmarks alone. We find that estimates of surface mesh shape (i.e., after re-semilandmarking and then re-warping) made with varying numbers of semilandmarks are generally consistent, while the warping of surfaces using landmarks alone yields surfaces that can be quite different to those based on semilandmarks, depending on landmark coverage and choice of template surface for warping.

Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which incorporate macroeconomic and climate variables, feature prominently in advisory content, though they rarely draw on data from outside strictly constrained hypothetical systems. This has led to assertions that they are not well-suited to approximate complex systemic human-environment processes. Modular, interdisciplinary approaches have offered a way to address this shortcoming; however, beyond climate records, prehistoric data continue to be under-utilised in developing such models. In this paper we highlight the contribution that archaeology and palaeoecology can make to the development of the next generation IAMs that are expected to enhance provision for more local and pro-active adaptations to future climate change. We present data from one of Southeast Asia's most heavily developed river deltas: the Red River (Song Hong) Delta, in Vietnam and localised analysis from the Tr&#xe0;ng An Landscape Complex World Heritage Site, on the delta's southern margin.

An observation of Ramses II Cartouche at the bottom side of the obelisk base inspired the authorities to provide an innovative architectural design to display the obelisk elevated. The supporting structure was designed to allow the visitors to walk underneath the obelisk and observe Ramses II's signature. The idea of elevating the obelisk presented several challenges including evaluating the obelisk's current condition, restoration and fixation methodology, structural stability, and uncertainties of material characteristics, amongst others. To control the obelisk deformations under lateral loading, state-of-the-art base isolators were introduced.

Mostly, these models aim to understand human patterns as a result of past climatic and environmental conditions over long-term periods. However, major limitations are the low spatial and temporal resolution of the environmental data, and hence the rather static model output. Particular challenges are thus the number of chosen variables, the comprehensiveness of the explanatory parameters, and the integration of socio-cultural decision-making into the model. Here, we present a novel approach to generate annually resolved landcover variability using a broad variety of climatic, geological, hydrological, topographical, and dendrochronological data composites (Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)). We analyze land-use and settlement capacity and vulnerability to estimate the socio-cultural transformation processes at Basel (Switzerland) during the Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Our results highlight the potential of the PDSI to predict local river run-off behavior from catchment analyses. The model enables to trace landcover as well as socio-cultural response to climatic variability and subsequent adaptation to trends in environmental vulnerability.

Informed by rich data, we aim to better understand and model the knowledge involved in situation- and function-based use of language register. In order to achieve this goal, we are using complementary methods and measures. In the review, we start by clarifying the concept of """"register"""", by reviewing the state of the art, and by setting out our methods and modeling goals. Against this background, we discuss three key challenges, two at the methodological level and one at the theoretical level: (1) To better uncover registers in text and spoken corpora, we propose changes to established analytical approaches. (2) To tease apart between-subject variability from the linguistic variability at issue (intra-individual situation-based register variability), we use within-subject designs and the modeling of individuals' social, language, and educational background. (3) We highlight a gap in cognitive modeling, viz. modeling the mental representations of register (processing), and present our first attempts at filling this gap. We argue that the targeted use of multiple complementary methods and measures supports investigating the pervasiveness of register phenomena and yields comprehensive insights into the cross-methodological robustness of register-related language variability.

Compiling data from various sources, it becomes apparent that violence was endemic in Neolithic Europe, sometimes reaching levels of intergroup hostilities that ended in the utter destruction of entire communities. While the precise comparative quantification of healed and unhealed trauma remains a fundamental problem, patterns emerge that see conflict likely fostered by increasing competition between settled and growing communities, e.g., for access to arable land for food production.

The first communities were small (tens to hundreds of individuals) but remained semisedentary. So-called megasites appeared soon after, occupied by thousands of more sedentary inhabitants. Accompanying this shift, the material culture and ancient ecological data indicate profound changes in economic and social behavior. A shift from residential to logistical mobility and increasing population size are clear and can be explained by either changes in fertility and/or aggregation of local groups. However, as sedentism increased, small early communities likely risked inbreeding without maintaining or establishing exogamous relationships typical of hunter-gatherers. Megasites, where large populations would have made endogamy sustainable, could have avoided this risk. To examine the role of kinship practices in the rise of megasites, we measured strontium and oxygen isotopes in tooth enamel from 99 individuals buried at P&#x131;narba&#x15f;&#x131;, Boncuklu, and &#xc7;atalh&#xf6;y&#xfc;k (Turkey) over 7,000 y.

It has long been held that different cortical areas evolved independently from each other to develop their unique functional specializations. However, some recent studies suggest that high integration between different cortical areas could facilitate the emergence of equally extreme, highly specialized brain functions. Here, we analyse the evolution of brain shape in primates using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics of endocasts. We aim to determine, firstly, whether modern humans present unique developmental patterns of covariation between brain cortical areas; and secondly, whether hominins experienced unusually high rates of evolution in brain covariation as compared to other primates. On the basis of analyses including modern humans and other extant great apes at different developmental stages, we first demonstrate that, unlike our closest living relatives, Homo sapiens retain high levels of covariation between cortical areas into adulthood. Among the other great apes, high levels of covariation are only found in immature individuals. Secondly, at the macro-evolutionary level, our analysis of 400 endocasts, representing 148 extant primate species and 6 fossil hominins, shows that strong covariation between different areas of the brain in H. sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis evolved under distinctly higher evolutionary rates than in any other primate, suggesting that natural selection favoured a greatly integrated brain in both species. These results hold when extinct species are excluded and allometric effects are accounted for. Our findings demonstrate that high covariation in the brain may have played a critical role in the evolution of unique cognitive capacities and complex behaviours in both modern humans and Neanderthals.",10.1038/s41559-022-01933-6,36604552,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 17:55:00.791860-04:00,No,,

HIPs are designed to provide students with the intellectual and practical skills to succeed in an increasingly unstable global world beyond college. Utilizing a private-public partnership forensic archeological contract project, this paper examines how this venture employed a HIP-based contractor model that hired students as a professional archeological field crew and provided them with a living wage, transportation, and room and board. It also provided students without the means to participate in international fieldwork with the wherewithal to do so, supporting underserved students and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) initiatives. Utilizing this HIP-based contract model resulted in greater student investment and collaboration in a fieldwork situation more akin to the real world, where students learned to solve problems, communicate, and network in an international setting, resulting in new opportunities, such as professional jobs, and academic projects and publications. The paid contractor model ensured students with limited resources could participate, broadening the type of student who can receive this type of training, expanding diversity in forensic anthropology. These models are not limited to forensic archeological fieldwork; they can also be applied to forensic anthropology laboratory projects.

However, the high temperature environments that characterise much of Africa often lead to poor preservation of skeletal remains. Here, we successfully reconstruct and analyse genome-wide data from the naturally mummified hair of a 4000-year-old individual from Sudan in northeastern Africa, after failed attempts at DNA extraction from teeth, petrous, and cranium of this and other individuals from the Kadruka cemeteries. We find that hair DNA extracted with an established single-stranded library protocol is unusually enriched in ultra-short DNA molecules and exhibits substantial interior molecular damage. The aDNA was nonetheless amenable to genetic analyses, which revealed that the genome is genetically indistinguishable from that of early Neolithic eastern African pastoralists located 2500 kms away. Our findings are consistent with established models for the southward dispersal of Middle Nile Valley pastoral populations to the Rift Valley of eastern Africa, and provide a possible genetic source population for this dispersal.

The remaining two-thirds were derived from the Taurus Mountains of Turkey, namely, from stream tin and residual low-grade mineralization remaining after extensive exploitation in the Early Bronze Age. The results of our metallurgical analysis, along with archaeological and textual data, illustrate that a culturally diverse, multiregional, and multivector system underpinned Eurasian tin exchange during the Late Bronze Age.

These studies have been aided enormously by the discovery that ancient DNA is relatively well preserved in the petrous bone compared to most other bones. The reasons for this better preservation are however not well understood. Here we examine the hypothesis that one reason for better DNA preservation in the petrous bone is that fresh petrous bone contains more DNA than other bones. We therefore determined the concentrations of osteocyte cells occluded inside lacunae within the petrous bone and compared these concentrations to other bones from the domestic pig using high resolution microCT. We show that the concentrations of osteocyte lacunae in the inner layer of the pig petrous bone adjacent to the otic chamber are about three times higher (around 95,000 lacunae per mm3) than in the mastoid of the temporal bone (around 28,000 lacunae per mm3), as well as the cortical bone of the femur (around 27,000 lacunae per mm3). The sizes and shapes of the lacuna in the inner layer of the petrous bone are similar to those in the femur. We also show that the pig petrous bone lacunae do contain osteocytes using a histological stain for DNA. We therefore confirm and significantly expand upon previous observations of osteocytic lacuna concentrations in the petrous bone, supporting the notion that one possible reason for better preservation of ancient DNA in the petrous bone is that this bone initially contains at least three times more DNA than other bones.

Here we present genetic data from Palaeolithic human individuals in the United Kingdom and the oldest human DNA thus far obtained from Britain or Ireland.

However, an individual from Kendrick's Cave shows no evidence of having ancestry related to the Gough's Cave individual. Instead, the Kendrick's Cave individual traces its ancestry to groups who expanded across Europe during the Late Glacial and are represented at sites such as Villabruna, Italy. Furthermore, the individuals differ not only in their genetic ancestry profiles but also in their mortuary practices and their diets and ecologies, as evidenced through stable isotope analyses.

While it is known that meat became an important part of the hominin diet around 2.6-2 Mya, whether intense cooperation and food sharing developed in conjunction with the regular intake of meat remains unresolved. A widespread assumption is that early hominins acquired animal protein through klepto-parasitism at felid kills. This should be testable by detecting felid-specific bone modifications and tooth marks on carcasses consumed by hominins. Here, deep learning (DL) computer vision was used to identify agency through the analysis of tooth pits and scores on bones recovered from the Early Pleistocene site of DS (Bed I, Olduvai Gorge). We present the first objective evidence of primary access to meat by hominins 1.8 Mya by showing that the most common securely detectable bone-modifying fissipeds at the site were hyenas. The absence of felid modifications in most of the carcasses analyzed indicates that hominins were the primary consumers of most animals accumulated at the site, with hyenas intervening at the post-depositional stage. This underscores the role of hominins as a prominent part of the early Pleistocene African carnivore guild.

Although the importance remains unknown, it has been suggested to play an important role in managing separations, mitigating the risk, and increasing social bonding beyond the interaction itself. In nonhuman species, the literature is virtually absent, but identifying leave taking beyond humans may provide unique insights into the evolutionary history of this behaviour and shed light onto its proximate and ultimate function(s). Methods to study leave taking are not well-established, and the variation in definitions, measures, and control variables presented in past studies poses additional challenges. Baboons are a valuable model for investigating human behavioural evolution: as a flexible, highly adaptable, and social primate whose radiation is, similarly to humans, associated with the emergence of the African savannah biome. Using the framework and definition proposed by Baehren, we investigated the presence of leave taking in a wild, generalist primate and tested a range of candidate behaviours on prerecorded video footage: (1) self-scratching, (2) eye gaze, and (3) orientation in the direction of parting. Using multivariate analysis, controlling for interaction duration and individual variation, our results show that orientation in the direction of parting occurs predominantly before social separation events. These results indicate evidence of leave taking in a wild nonhuman population and contrast with previous ideas that this is a uniquely human behaviour.

Blade technology first occurred at Shuidonggou Locality 1 and 2 around 41 ka cal BP while core-and-flake assemblages were widespread in North China. However, systematic technological studies on assemblages postdating 34 ka cal BP have not been conducted to examine whether the blade technology appeared and disappeared over a short yet abrupt episode, or persists and integrates into other forms in the region. Here, we conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses to reconstruct lithic productions on the assemblages at Shuidonggou Locality 2, dated after 34 ka cal BP. Our results show that there is a total absence of laminar elements in stone artifacts dated to 34-28 ka cal BP at Shuidonggou. Instead, we observe a dominance of an expedient production of flakes in the younger assemblages, illustrating a rapid return to flake-based technology after a relatively brief episode of stone blade production.

10495,A study of potential laser-induced degradation in remote standoff Raman spectroscopy for wall paintings.,,,,,,European physical journal plus,Eur Phys J Plus,11,10,2022,"A mobile remote standoff Raman spectroscopy system operational at typical distances of 10&#xa0;m was developed specifically for research of historical sites and wall paintings recently. Here we present an upgrade to that system informed by a thorough experimental investigation of the relevant laser-induced degradation issues. Reflectance spectroscopy as a more sensitive technique than Raman spectroscopy was used for monitoring and a new phenomenon of reversible alterations was detected in many paint samples at very low laser intensities of less than 1&#xa0;W/cm<sup>2</sup> when Raman measurements detected no changes. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the intensity threshold for safe operation was found to decrease significantly for larger incident irradiation area in the case of a vermilion oil paint sample. Damage threshold in intensity for each material needs to be determined for different spot sizes, which can be orders of magnitude lower for 1&#xa0;mm spot size compared with micro-Raman. Results from this study is also relevant to portable Raman systems which use similarly large spot sizes. However, the larger spot size still generates more Raman photons overall under safe operation than micro-Raman systems. Continuous-wave (CW) lasers are found to be best suited to efficient, that is more Raman signal detected over a given measurement time, and safe Raman operation than ns-pulse lasers at the same wavelength. While the damage threshold in intensity for ns-pulse lasers is much higher than that of CW lasers, the pulse energy allowed in one pulse for safe operation is still too low to allow detection of Raman signal, and the need for multiple pulses makes pulse laser inefficient owing to the low repetition rate necessary to ensure adequate heat dissipation between pulses. The safety of the upgraded system was evaluated and found that no permanent laser-induced degradation was detected within 60&#xa0;s of laser irradiation for any of the paint samples.",10.1140/epjp/s13360-022-03305-2,36213053,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:22:34.999641-04:00,No,,

One of the most common approaches involves the convergence of observers for repeat trails on the same set of artefacts: however, this is logistically and financially challenging when collaborating internationally and/or at a large scale. We present and evaluate a unique alternative for testing inter-observer error, involving the development of 3D printed copies of a lithic reference collection for distribution among observers. With the aim of reducing error, clear protocols were developed for photographing and measuring the replicas, and inter-observer variability was assessed on the replicas in comparison with a corresponding data set recorded by a single observer. Our results demonstrate that, when the photography procedure is standardized and dimensions are clearly defined, the resulting metric and geometric morphometric data are minimally affected by inter-observer error, supporting this method as an effective solution for assessing error under collaborative research frameworks. Collaboration is becoming increasingly important within archaeological and anthropological sciences in order to increase the accessibility of samples, encourage dual-project development between foreign and local researchers and reduce the carbon footprint of collection-based research. This study offers a promising validation of a collaborative research design whereby researchers remotely work together to produce comparable data capturing lithic shape variability.

The Early Middle Magdalenian (19,5-17,5 ka cal. BP) thereby extends from Poland to Spain, and the sharing of the flint-knapping concepts and the circulation of raw materials show the existence of networks active over this wide area. In parallel, part of the production of art, ornaments, microliths, bone industry, and the proportions of hunted ungulates vary regionally and allow to identify distinct technical traditions. Departing from a palethnographic approach at a regional scale, this paper aims at participating in renewing our understanding of the mechanisms of regionalisation during the period, and among past societies of hunter-gatherers. The reflection is based on the techno-functional analysis of stone tools from two cave sites of west-central France that are at the heart of the definition of two technical traditions: La Marche (Magdalenian with Lussac-Angles points) and the Blanchard cave (Magdalenian with navettes). Inter-site comparisons of the functioning and management of stone tools, and of subsistence strategies show the sharing of techno-economical norms, expressing the adhesion to a wider community of practice. The long-term occupation of at least part of the caves and the high density of sites in the Vienne, the Creuse, the Gartempe, and the Charente Valleys, indicate the strong regional implantation of human societies. This strong territoriality (effective and symbolic) is likely a major factor to understand the specificity of the EMM expressions in the area, as well as the sharing, in the same economic territory, of technical norms and of part of the system of symbolic representation.",10.1371/journal.pone.0274819,36197887,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 18:02:37.648346-04:00,No,,

The effect of geopolitical change on human subsistence, especially the shifts between agricultural and nomadic regimes, has not been well understood due to the absence of detailed historical records and archaeological evidence. During the 12th century, the control of the Zhengding area in Hebei Province of north-central China changed from the Northern Song (960-1127 CE) to the <i>Jurchen</i> Jin Dynasty (Jin Dynasty; 1115-1234 CE). Recent excavation of the Zhengding Kaiyuan Temple South (ZKS) site in the area provides a rare opportunity to study human livelihood transformation in relation to geopolitical change. In total, 21,588 charred crop caryopses including foxtail millet, wheat, broomcorn millet, hulled barley, and rice, and other carbonized remains including 55.15 g of boiled foxtail millet and 353.5 g of foxtail millet caryopses were identified, and nine AMS <sup>14</sup>C dates of crop remains were obtained from the Northern Song and Jin layers at the ZKS site. This revealed that the dominant plant subsistence transformed from wheat to foxtail millet during the change from the Northern Song to the Jin Dynasties in Zhengding area. By comparing with historical documents and paleoclimate records, we propose that this abnormal shift of primary staple food from the relatively high-yield wheat to low-yield foxtail millet was induced by the traditional dietary preference for foxtail millet in the nomadic Jin society. The Jin government levied foxtail millet as taxation and promoted massive immigration from northeastern China to north-central China to consolidate their rule, which resulted in the adoption of foxtail millet as the most important crop in Zhengding area. The advantage for the cultivation of this frost-sensitive crop in north-central China over northeast China was probably enhanced by notable cold events during the 12th century, while the primary influencing factor for the transformation of human livelihoods in north-central China during that period was geopolitics rather than climate change.",10.3389/fpls.2022.978147,36186048,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:12:17.816870-04:00,No,,

The study identified a major change in crops where oil plants played a key role in the site's initial phase before being supplanted over the course of a few decades by naked wheat, barley and pea. Wild plants continued to be gathered albeit in different proportions. In the latest settlement phase, the changes in the local vegetation and in the values of the analyses of carbon stable isotopes suggest a less humid environment. The hypothesis is that the changes perceived in the plant economy represent a resilience strategy adopted by the inhabitants in reaction to short term local climatic alterations. The two types of soil sampling techniques (monolith and bulk) allowed comparing these results. While the density of plant remains appears to be underestimated among the samples collected by the monolith technique, the proportions of economic taxa remain unaffected. The findings thus reveal that when the bulk samplings are distributed carefully throughout multiphase sites and avoid mixing stratigraphical units, and if the samplings are representative of all archaeological features from a whole area, then each of the two techniques offer analogous results.",10.1371/journal.pone.0274361,36170265,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:10:52.137643-04:00,No,,

This study presents the first investigation into the fuel sources relied upon by this industry during its most intensive period, as reflected by hundreds of charcoal samples collected from two well-stratified and chronologically anchored accumulations of industrial waste. The two sites demonstrate similar results: a heavy reliance on the local vegetation, particularly Retama raetam (white broom) and the ecologically significant Acacia spp. (acacia thorn trees), two high-calorific and high-burning taxa best suited for such purposes. It was also observed that over the course of the industry, the search for fuel expanded, as evidenced by the later appearance of taxa unsuited for the prevailing regional conditions, hinting at the detrimental toll the industry took on the local ecosystem.

Due to primates having highly developed visual systems, there have been limited attempts to quantify the benefit of olfactory enrichment on captive primate populations. We aim to investigate how a range of odors may influence the behaviors of two captive New World primate species that have varying reliance on olfactory pathways, black-capped capuchin (Sapajus apella) and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), at the National Zoo and Aquarium, Canberra, Australia. We presented three odors (rosemary oil, Salvia rosmarinus, banana essence and white-tailed deer urine, Odocoileus virginianus) four different times to the two species following a 12-week randomized schedule. Using instantaneous scan sampling we collected behavioral and direct cloth interaction (DCI) data on 40 days. We then calculated activity budgets.

Overall, the chloroplast genomes contained a low amount of diversity with domesticated accessions separated by a maximum of 5 SNPs and little inference on demography could be made. However, in phylogenies the chloroplast genomes separated into two clades, similar to what has been reported for nuclear DNA from P. miliaceum. The chloroplast genomes of two wild (undomesticated) accessions of P. miliaceum contained a relatively large number of variants, 11 SNPs, not found in the domesticated accessions.

However, recent research has shown that the process underlying our origins was considerably more complex. While archaeological and fossil evidence suggests that behavioural complexity may not be confined to the modern human lineage, recent palaeogenomic work shows that gene flow between distinct lineages (for example, Neanderthals, Denisovans, early H. sapiens) occurred repeatedly in the late Pleistocene, probably contributing elements to our genetic make-up that might have been crucial to our success as a diverse, adaptable species. Following these advances, the prevailing human origins model has shifted from one of near-complete replacement to a more nuanced view of partial replacement with considerable reticulation. Here we provide a brief introduction to the current genetic evidence for hybridization among hominins, its prevalence in, and effects on, comparative mammal groups, and especially how it manifests in the skull. We then explore the degree to which cranial variation seen in the fossil record of late Pleistocene hominins from Western Eurasia corresponds with our current genetic and comparative data. We are especially interested in understanding the degree to which skeletal data can reflect admixture. Our findings indicate some correspondence between these different lines of evidence, flag individual fossils as possibly admixed, and suggest that different cranial regions may preserve hybridization signals differentially. We urge further studies of the phenotype to expand our ability to detect the ways in which migration, interaction and genetic exchange have shaped the human past, beyond what is currently visible with the lens of ancient DNA.",10.1038/s41559-022-01875-z,36064759,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 01:42:15.618791-04:00,No,,
10584,Reconstructing Articular Cartilage in the <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> Hip Joint and the Need for Modeling Six Degrees of Freedom.,,,,,,"Integrative organismal biology (Oxford, England)",Integr Org Biol,07,09,2022,"""The postcranial skeleton of <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> (AL 288-1) exhibits clear adaptations for bipedality, although there is some debate as to the efficiency and frequency of such upright movement. Some researchers argue that AL 288-1 walked with an erect limb like modern humans do, whilst others advocate for a """"bent-hip bent-knee"""" (BHBK) gait, although in recent years the general consensus favors erect bipedalism. To date, no quantitative method has addressed the articulation of the AL 288-1 hip joint, nor its range of motion (ROM) with consideration for joint spacing, used as a proxy for the thickness of the articular cartilage present within the joint spacing which can affect how a joint moves. Here, we employed ROM mapping methods to estimate the joint spacing of AL 288-1's hip joint in comparison to a modern human and chimpanzee. Nine simulations assessed different joint spacing and tested the range of joint congruency (i.e., ranging from a closely packed socket to loosely packed). We further evaluated the sphericity of the femoral head and whether three rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs) sufficiently captures the full ROM or if translational DOFs must be included. With both setups, we found that the AL 288-1 hip was unlikely to be highly congruent (as it is in modern humans) because this would severely restrict hip rotational movement and would severely limit the capability for both bipedality and even arboreal locomotion. Rather, the hip was more cartilaginous than it is in the modern humans, permitting the hip to rotate into positions necessitated by both terrestrial and arboreal movements. Rotational-only simulations found that AL 288-1 was unable to extend the hip like modern humans, forcing the specimen to employ a BHBK style of walking, thus contradicting 40+&#xa0;years of previous research into the locomotory capabilities of AL 288-1. Therefore, we advocate that differences in the sphericity of the AL 288-1 femoral head with that of a modern human necessitates all six DOFs to be included in which AL 288-1 could osteologically extend the hip to facilitate a human-like gait. Das postkraniale Skelett von <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> (AL 288&#x2013;1) weisst deutliche Anpassungen f&#xfc;r einen aufrechten Gang auf, allerdings ist die Effizienz und H&#xe4;ufigkeit der aufrechten Fortbewegung umstritten. Einige Forscher argumentieren, dass AL 288&#x2013;1 wie der moderne Mensch mit aufrechten Beinen lief, w&#xe4;hrend andere der Ansicht sind einen Gang mit gebeugter H&#xfc;fte und gebeugtem Knie (BHBK&#x2014;<i>bent-hip bent-knee</i>) scheine wahrscheinlicher, obwohl in den letzten Jahren der allgemeine Konsens die aufrechte Zweibeinigkeit bevorzugt. Bislang wurde mit quantitativen Methoden weder die Artikulation des AL 288&#x2013;1 H&#xfc;ftgelenkes noch dessen Bewegungsumfang (ROM&#x2014;<i>range of motion</i>), mit Einbezug des Gelenkzwischenraumes untersucht, welcher als Indikator f&#xfc;r die Dicke des Gelenkknorpels dient und beeinflussen kann, wie sich ein Gelenk bewegt. Hier verwendeten wir die ROM-Mapping-Methode, um den Abstand zwischen den Gelenksfl&#xe4;chen in der H&#xfc;fte von AL 288&#x2013;1, im Vergleich zu einem modernen Menschen und einem Schimpansen, zu bestimmen. In neun Simulationen wurden unterschiedliche Gelenkabst&#xe4;nde und die Variationsbreite der Gelenkskongruenz (d. h. von einer enganliegenden bis zu einer locker sitzenden H&#xfc;ftpfanne) getestet. Dar&#xfc;ber hinaus haben wir die Kugelf&#xf6;rmigkeit des Oberschenkelkopfes untersucht und gepr&#xfc;ft, ob drei rotierende Freiheitsgrade (DOFs&#x2014;<i>degrees of freedom</i>) ausreichen, um das gesamte ROM zu erfassen, oder ob zus&#xe4;tzlich translatorische DOFs einbezogen werden m&#xfc;ssen. Bei beiden Versuchsanordnungen stellten wir fest, dass die H&#xfc;fte von AL 288&#x2013;1 wahrscheinlich nicht hochgradig kongruent war (im Gegensatz zum modernen Menschen), da dies die Rotationsf&#xe4;higkeit der H&#xfc;fte stark eingeschr&#xe4;nkt und sowohl die F&#xe4;higkeit zur zweibeinigen Fortbewegung als auch zu deren in den B&#xe4;umen stark beeintr&#xe4;chtigt h&#xe4;tte. Stattdessen war die H&#xfc;fte vermutlich mit mehr Knorpel ausgestattet als beim modernen Menschen, so dass sie sich in Positionen drehen konnte, die sowohl f&#xfc;r Bewegungen am Boden als auch in den B&#xe4;umen erforderlich waren. Reine Rotations-Simulationen ergaben, dass AL 288&#x2013;1 nicht in der Lage gewesen w&#xe4;re, die H&#xfc;fte wie ein moderner Mensch zu strecken, so dass das Individuum gezwungen gewesen w&#xe4;re, im BHBK-Stil zu gehen, was mehr als 40 Jahre vorangegangener Forschung &#xfc;ber die Fortbewegungsf&#xe4;higkeiten von AL 288&#x2013;1 widersprochen h&#xe4;tte. Daher sind wir der Auffassung, dass aufgrund der Unterschiede in der Kugelf&#xf6;rmigkeit des H&#xfc;ftkopfes von AL 288&#x2013;1 und demjenigen eines modernen Menschen alle sechs DOFs einbezogen werden m&#xfc;ssen, damit AL 288&#x2013;1 die H&#xfc;fte osteologisch so strecken konnte, dass ein menschen&#xe4;hnlicher Gang m&#xf6;glich gewesen w&#xe4;re. Het postcrani&#xeb;le skelet van <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> (AL 288&#x2013;1) vertoont duidelijke aanpassingen voor tweevoetigheid, hoewel er enige discussie bestaat over de effici&#xeb;ntie en de frequentie van deze rechtopgaande beweging. Sommige onderzoekers beweren dat AL 288&#x2013;1 met een recht ledemaat liep zoals de moderne mens, terwijl anderen pleiten voor een &#x201c;bent-hip bent-knee&#x201d; (BHBK (vertaling: <i>gebogen-heup gebogen-knie</i>) gang, hoewel de laatste jaren de algemene consensus uitgaat naar een erect bipedalisme. Tot op heden heeft geen enkele kwantitatieve methode zich gebogen over de articulatie van het AL 288&#x2013;1 heupgewricht, noch over het bewegingsbereik (ROM) met inachtneming van de gewrichtsafstand, die wordt gebruikt als benadering voor de dikte van het gewrichtskraakbeen dat in de gewrichtsafstand aanwezig is en dat de manier waarop een gewricht beweegt kan be&#xef;nvloeden. Hier hebben we ROM mapping methoden gebruikt om de kraakbeendikte en gewrichtsafstand van het heupgewricht van AL 288&#x2013;1 te schatten in vergelijking met die van een moderne mens en chimpansee. Negen simulaties evalueerden verschillende gewrichtsafstanden en testten het bereik van gewrichtscongruentie (d.w.z., vari&#xeb;rend van een dicht opeen gepakte kom tot een los opeengepakte kom). Verder evalueerden wij de bolvormigheid van de femurkop en of drie roterende vrijheidsgraden (DOF's&#x2014;<i>degrees of freedom</i>) de volledige ROM voldoende weergeven of dat de translatorische DOF's moeten worden meegenomen. In beide gevallen bleek dat de heup van de AL 288&#x2013;1 waarschijnlijk niet zeer congruent was (zoals wordt gezien bij de moderne mens), omdat dit de rotatiebeweging van de heup ernstig zou beperken en het vermogen tot tweevoetigheid en zelfs tot voortbewegen in bomen ernstig zou beperken. In plaats daarvan had de heup meer kraakbeen dan bij de moderne mens, waardoor de heup kon roteren in posities die nodig zijn voor zowel bewegingen op het land als in de bomen. Simulaties van enkel rotatie toonden aan dat AL 288&#x2013;1 niet in staat was om de heup te strekken zoals de moderne mens, waardoor het specimen gedwongen werd om een BHBK manier van lopen toe te passen. Dit is in tegenspraak met meer dan 40 jaar van eerder onderzoek naar de locomotorische capaciteiten van AL 288&#x2013;1. Daarom stellen wij dat de verschillen in bolvorm van de femurkop van AL 288&#x2013;1 ten opzichte van die van de moderne mens vereisen dat alle zes DOFs worden opgenomen waarin AL 288&#x2013;1 de heup osteologisch zou kunnen strekken om een mensachtige loopbeweging mogelijk te maken.""",10.1093/iob/obac031,36060864,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:44:28.667811-04:00,No,,

Humans are unusual in possessing depigmented sclerae whereas many other extant primates, including the closely-related chimpanzee, possess dark scleral pigment. Here, we use phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) analyses with previously generated species-level scores of proactive prosociality, social tolerance (both n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15 primate species), and conspecific lethal aggression (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;108 primate species) to provide the first quantitative, comparative test of three existing hypotheses. The 'self-domestication' and 'cooperative eye' explanations predict white sclerae to be associated with cooperative, rather than competitive, environments. The 'gaze camouflage' hypothesis predicts that dark scleral pigment functions as gaze direction camouflage in competitive social environments. Notably, the experimental evidence that non-human primates draw social information from conspecific eye movements is unclear, with the latter two hypotheses having recently been challenged. Here, we show that white sclerae in primates are associated with increased cooperative behaviours whereas dark sclerae are associated with reduced cooperative behaviours and increased conspecific lethal violence.

Although the occupation of Pot Creek Pueblo was short, it occurred during a pivotal period in the Northern Rio Grande. The population of the region increased rapidly at this time, possibly due to an influx of migrants from the Mesa Verde/San Juan area to the west, and locally people living in relatively small villages comprised of pithouses and above-ground unit pueblos begin to coalesce into fewer, but much larger above-ground pueblos. Obsidian-source choices throughout the region may provide insight into how the proposed migration impacted existing resource-procurement patterns.

Understanding herd management and mobility using isotopic characterizations of cattle tooth enamel from Early Dynastic Ur.,,,,,Agriculture; Animals; Burial; Cattle; Dental Enamel; Diet; Strontium Isotopes,PloS one,PLoS One,17,06,2022,"During the third millennium BC, Mesopotamia (the land between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, in modern Iraq-Syria), was dominated by the world's earliest cities and states, which were ruled by powerful elites. Ur, in present-day southern Iraq, was one of the largest and most important of these cities, and irrigation-based agriculture and large herds of domesticated animals were the twin mainstays of the economy and diet. Texts suggest that the societies of the Mesopotamian city-states were extremely hierarchical and underpinned by institutionalised and heavily-managed farming systems. Prevailing narratives suggest that the animal management strategies within these farming systems in the third millennium BC were homogenous. There have been few systematic science-based studies of human and animal diets, mobility, or other forms of human-animal interaction in Mesopotamia, but such approaches can inform understanding of past economies, including animal management, social hierarchies, diet and migration. Oxygen, carbon and strontium isotopic analysis of animal tooth enamel from both royal and private/non-royal burial contexts at Early Dynastic Ur (2900-2350 BC) indicate that a variety of herd management strategies and habitats were exploited. These data also suggest that there is no correlation between animal-management practices and the cattle found in royal or private/non-royal burial contexts. The results demonstrate considerable divergence between agro-pastoral models promoted by the state and the realities of day-to-day management practices. The data from Ur suggest that the animals exploited different plant and water sources, and that animals reared in similar ways ended up in different depositional contexts.",10.1371/journal.pone.0265170,35704593,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:16:52.351382-04:00,No,,

A key Final Pleistocene techno-tradition is the Howiesons Poort, which is marked by an increase in behavioral complexity and technological innovation. Central to this techno-tradition is the production of backed artifacts-small, sharp blades likely used as insets in composite tools. Although backed artifacts were manufactured for thousands of years before the Howiesons Poort, this period is marked by a phenomenal increase in their production. In this paper we test both social and environmental hypotheses to explain this phenomenon. We correlate environmental data with changing frequencies of backed artifact production at Sibudu and assess morphological similarity across seven sites in southern Africa. We find that these artifacts are made to a similar template across different regions and that their increased production correlates with multiple paleo-environmental proxies. When compared to an Australian outgroup, the backed artifacts from the seven southern African sites cluster within the larger shape space described by the Australian group. This leads us to argue that the observed standardized across southern Africa is related to cultural similarities and marks a strengthening of long-distance social ties during the MIS4.",10.1038/s41598-022-12677-5,35680943,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:09:34.591526-04:00,No,,

In China, this period roughly corresponds with the Zhou Dynasty (1046-212 BC), a critical period when ancient Chinese civilization was experiencing significant cultural and technological changes, including the movement of people to modern-day Jiangsu Province, where they intensively used the natural resources found in this the coastal area. Recent archaeobotanical evidence, and two radiocarbon dates on wheat and foxtail millet, indicate that the Datongpu site, which dates around 2,600 cal a BP, was occupied during this period of transition around the 2.8 ka BP climate event. In total, our investigations recovered 3,399 carbonized seeds from seventy-four flotation samples, of which rice, foxtail millet, broomcorn millet, and wheat seeds where predominant along with 2,296 weed seeds. Additionally, we identified several rice spikelets and wheat rachises. The high number of carbonized rice grains indicates that rice farming was the primary crop in an otherwise mixed rice-dry farming system at Datongpu. In addition, we argue that the """"2.8 ka BP cold event"""" probably influenced population growth and caused food shortages throughout Central China, leading people to migrate southeastward along the Huai River to the coastal areas of Jianghuai Region.

Gorillas are commonly considered to be folivorous primates because they possess sharp cusped molars which are adapted to process fibrous leafy foods. However, the proportion of fruit in their diet can vary significantly depending on their habitats. While tooth morphology can tell us what a tooth is capable of processing, tooth wear can help us to understand how teeth have been used during mastication. The objective of this study is to explore if differences in diet at the subspecies level can be detected by the analysis of molar macrowear. We analysed a large sample of second lower molars of Grauer's, mountain and western lowland gorilla by combining the Occlusal Fingerprint Analysis method with other dental measurements. We found that Grauer's and western lowland gorillas are characterised by a macrowear pattern indicating a larger intake of fruit in their diet, while mountain gorilla's macrowear is associated with the consumption of more folivorous foods.

Methods using mitochondrial markers are usually reliant on reference databases, but these are often incomplete. Furthermore, available mitochondrial genomes often lack crucial metadata, such as sampling location, limiting their utility for many analyses. Here, we assembled 205 new mitochondrial genomes for platyrrhine primates, most from the Amazon and with known sampling locations. We present a dated mitogenomic phylogeny based on these samples along with additional published platyrrhine mitogenomes, and use this to assess support for the long-standing riverine barrier hypothesis (RBH), which proposes that river formation was a major driver of speciation in Amazonian primates. Along the Amazon, Negro, and Madeira rivers, we found mixed support for the RBH. While we identified divergences that coincide with a river barrier, only some occur synchronously and also overlap with the proposed dates of river formation. The most compelling evidence is for the Amazon river potentially driving speciation within bearded saki monkeys (Chiropotes spp.) and within the smallest extant platyrrhines, the marmosets and tamarins. However, we also found that even large rivers do not appear to be barriers for some primates, including howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.), uakaris (Cacajao spp.), sakis (Pithecia spp.), and robust capuchins (Sapajus spp.). Our results support a more nuanced, clade-specific effect of riverine barriers and suggest that other evolutionary mechanisms, besides the RBH and allopatric speciation, may have played an important role in the diversification of platyrrhines.",10.1111/mec.16554,35638312,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:12:34.439914-04:00,No,,

They embody many functions and values, as they affect the productional, ecological and hydrological functioning of the landscape, its cultural values, the way people perceive the landscape, and their impact on present-day farming. As an aspect of the historical landscape, field systems are a topic investigated in landscape archaeology, environmental studies, historical geography, landscape ecology, and related disciplines. Historical field systems can form many complex spatial structures, shapes and patterns. This paper focuses on identifying environmental and historical/cultural driving forces during the formation and the historical development of various field pattern types.

The pyre area, located along the upper Adige valley, is dated to the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1150-950 BCE) and has yielded an unprecedented quantity of cremated human remains (about 63.5 kg), along with burnt animal bone fragments, shards of pottery, and other grave goods made in bronze and animal bone/antler. This study focuses on the bioanthropological analysis of the human remains and discusses the formation of the unusual burnt deposits at Salorno through comparisons with modern practices and protohistoric and contemporaneous archaeological deposits. The patterning of bone fragmentation and commingling was investigated using spatial data recorded during excavation which, along with the bioanthropological and archaeological data, are used to model and test two hypotheses: Salorno-Dos de la Forca would be the result of A) repeated primary cremations left in situ; or B) of residual material remaining after select elements were removed for internment in urns or burials to unknown depositional sites. By modelling bone weight and demographic data borrowed from regional affine contexts, the authors suggest that this cremation site may have been used over several generations by a small community-perhaps a local elite. With a quantity of human remains that exceeds that of any other coeval contexts interpreted as ustrina, Salorno may be the product of a complex series of rituals in which the human cremains did not receive individual burial, but were left in situ, in a collective/communal place of primary combustion, defining an area of repeated funeral ceremonies involving offerings and libations across a few generations.

Parasites provide valuable archaeological insights into historical health, sanitation, hygiene, dietary and culinary practices, as well as other factors. Differences in the prevalence of helminths over time may help us understand factors that affected the rate of infection of these parasites in past populations. While communal deposits often contain relatively high numbers of parasite eggs, these cannot be used to calculate prevalence rates, which are a key epidemiological measure of infection. The prevalence of intestinal helminths was investigated through time in England, based on analysis of 464 human burials from 17 sites, dating from the Prehistoric to Industrial periods. Eggs from two faecal-oral transmitted nematodes (Ascaris sp. and Trichuris sp.) and the food-derived cestodes (Taenia spp. and Diphyllobothrium latum syn Dibothriocephalus latus) were identified, although only Ascaris was detected at a high frequency. The changing prevalence of nematode infections can be attributed to changes in effective sanitation or other factors that affect these faecal-oral transmitted parasites and the presence of cestode infections reflect dietary and culinary preferences. These results indicate that the impact of helminth infections on past populations varied over time, and that some locations witnessed a dramatic reduction in parasite prevalence during the industrial era (18th-19th century), whereas other locations continued to experience high prevalence levels. The factors underlying these reductions and the variation in prevalence provide a key historical context for modern anthelmintic programs.",10.1371/journal.pntd.0010312,35446843,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:40:00.579737-04:00,No,,

This is crucial given that climate change may structure population growth and carrying capacity, while both climate and population influence per capita resource availability. This study couples paleoclimatic and demographic data with osteological evaluations of lethal trauma from 149 directly accelerator mass spectrometry 14C-dated individuals from the Nasca highland region of Peru. Multiple local and supraregional precipitation proxies are combined with a summed probability distribution of 149 14C dates to estimate population dynamics during a 700-y study window. Counter to previous findings, our analysis reveals a precipitous increase in violent deaths associated with a period of productive and stable climate, but volatile population dynamics. We conclude that favorable local climate conditions fostered population growth that put pressure on the marginal and highly circumscribed resource base, resulting in violent resource competition that manifested in over 450 y of internecine warfare. These findings help support a general theory of intergroup violence, indicating that relative resource scarcity&#x2014;whether driven by reduced resource abundance or increased competition&#x2014;can lead to violence in subsistence societies when the outcome is lower per capita resource availability.",10.1073/pnas.2117556119,35446706,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 01:04:08.446821-04:00,No,,

The first manifestations of this phenomenon occurred in modern-day France with the long mounds of the Cerny culture. Here, we present genome-wide data from the fifth-millennium BCE site of Fleury-sur-Orne in Normandy (France), famous for its impressively long monuments built for selected individuals. The site encompasses 32 monuments of variable sizes, containing the burials of 19 individuals from the Neolithic period. To address who was buried at the site, we generated genome-wide data for 14 individuals, of whom 13 are males, completing previously published data [M. Rivollat et al., Sci. Adv. 6, eaaz5344 (2020)]. Population genetic and Y chromosome analyses show that the Fleury-sur-Orne group fits within western European Neolithic genetic diversity and that the arrival of a new group is detected after 4,000 calibrated BCE. The results of analyzing uniparentally inherited markers and an overall low number of long runs of homozygosity suggest a patrilineal group practicing female exogamy. We find two pairs of individuals to be father and son, buried together in the same monument/grave. No other biological relationship can link monuments together, suggesting that each monument was dedicated to a genetically independent lineage. The combined data and documented father&#x2013;son line of descent suggest a male-mediated transmission of sociopolitical authority.

10947,Evoked and transmitted culture models: Using bayesian methods to infer the evolution of cultural traits in history.,,,,,"Anthropology, Cultural; Archaeology; Bayes Theorem; Cultural Evolution; Phylogeny",PloS one,PLoS One,14,04,2022,"A central question in behavioral and social sciences is understanding to what extent cultural traits are inherited from previous generations, transmitted from adjacent populations or produced in response to changes in socioeconomic and ecological conditions. As quantitative diachronic databases recording the evolution of cultural artifacts over many generations are becoming more common, there is a need for appropriate data-driven methods to approach this question. Here we present a new Bayesian method to infer the dynamics of cultural traits in a diachronic dataset. Our method called Evoked-Transmitted Cultural model (ETC) relies on fitting a latent-state model where a cultural trait is a latent variable which guides the production of the cultural artifacts observed in the database. The dynamics of this cultural trait may depend on the value of the cultural traits present in previous generations and in adjacent populations (transmitted culture) and/or on ecological factors (evoked culture). We show how ETC models can be fitted to quantitative diachronic or synchronic datasets, using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, enabling estimating the relative contribution of vertical transmission, horizontal transmission and evoked component in shaping cultural traits. The method also allows to reconstruct the dynamics of cultural traits in different regions. We tested the performance of the method on synthetic data for two variants of the method (for binary or continuous traits). We found that both variants allow reliable estimates of parameters guiding cultural evolution, and that they outperform purely phylogenetic tools that ignore horizontal transmission and ecological factors. Overall, our method opens new possibilities to reconstruct how culture is shaped from quantitative data, with possible application in cultural history, cultural anthropology, archaeology, historical linguistics and behavioral ecology.",10.1371/journal.pone.0264509,35389995,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:19:34.985929-04:00,No,,

Sampling was confined to clasts of Navilawa Monzonite, an intrusive rock that crops out only along the upper reaches of the river. The sampled gravels consisted of stream-bed surface material obtained from transects normal to the active channel. An additional sample was collected from an outcrop of fresh Navilawa Monzonite undergoing active physical breakdown on the side of the bedrock channel immediately adjacent to the river. A total of 883 clasts, ranging in diameter (<i>b</i>-axis) from 12 to 337&#xa0;mm, was collected. The long (<i>a</i>), intermediate (<i>b</i>) and short (<i>c</i>) axis of each clast was measured, along with the diameter of the sharpest corner of the maximum projection outline (<i>D<sub>i</sub></i> ) and the diameter of the maximum inscribed circle (<i>D<sub>k</sub></i> ).

The earliest probable evidence of Neanderthals in Asia comes from Karain E Cave (Anatolia, Turkey), dated to 250-200&#xa0;ka. We present four Chibanian (Middle Pleistocene) hominin specimens, representing at least two individuals, from Velika Balanica Cave (Serbia): a permanent upper third molar (BH-2), a deciduous upper fourth premolar (BH-3) refitted to a poorly preserved maxillary fragment with the permanent first molar in the alveolus (BH-4), and a permanent upper central incisor (BH-5).

We present here the results of our on-site explorations (excavations, surveys and surface-collections), focusing on the findings deriving from the Terraces. Diverse rock damage patterns were identified and described, portraying systematic rock mass-exploitation through quarrying fronts, natural rock joints and fissures enlargement, drilling and chiseling. There are multiple indications that the local bedrock (Bi'na Formation, Turonian) comprising flint and limestone was quarried under a systematic quality evaluation, leaving residual flint unsuitable for exploitation. Of interest to note that nearly all of the flint artifacts excavated and collected on the Terraces were made on raw material transported from the Hilltop (Mishash Formation, Campanian), knapped in-situ, on the quarried rock surfaces of the slopes. The flint tools bear witness to intensive use involving mainly boring and drilling. The dominant tool type is the flint axe for which a variety of waste products related to its production were found in-situ, enabling the reconstruction of axe reduction sequence. Similar axes and waste products were found in many PPN sites indicating that there was a common, widely-used scheme of making flint axes during the PPN. Interestingly, besides the flint waste, there were also limestone waste products typical of the last shaping and thinning stages of axe production, indicating that limestone axes were shaped technologically similar to the flint ones, contrary to what has been assumed before. Rare findings, such as obsidian pieces, originating from much further a-field indicate ties with other PPN communities, near and/or far.

Trabecular structure, then, can provide a record of variation in loading directions and magnitude; and in ontogenetic samples, it can potentially be used to track developmental shifts in limb posture. We aim to broaden the analysis of trabecular bone ontogeny by incorporating interactions between ontogenetic variation in locomotor repertoire, neuromuscular maturation, and life history. We examine the associations between these variables and age-related variation in trabecular structure in the calcaneus of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We used high-resolution micro-computed tomography scanning to image the calcaneus in a cross-sectional sample of 34 juvenile M. fuscata aged between 0 and 7&#xa0;years old at the Primate Research Institute, Japan. We calculated whole bone averages of standard trabecular properties and generated whole-bone morphometric maps of bone volume fraction and Young's modulus. Trabecular structure becomes increasingly heterogeneous in older individuals. Bone volume fraction (BV/total volume [TV]) decreases during the first month of life and increases afterward, coinciding with the onset of independent locomotion in M. fuscata. At birth, primary Young's modulus is oriented orthogonal to the ossification center, but after locomotor onset bone structure becomes stiffest in the direction of joint surfaces and muscle attachments. Age-related variation in bone volume fraction is best predicted by an interaction between the estimated percentage of adult brain size, body mass, and locomotor onset. To explain our findings, we propose a model where interactions between age-related increases in body weight and maturation of the neuromuscular system alter the loading environment of the calcaneus, to which the internal trabecular structure dynamically adapts. This model cannot be directly tested based on our cross-sectional data. However, confirmation of the model by longitudinal experiments and in multiple species would show that trabecular structure can be used both to infer behavior from fossil morphology and serve as a valuable proxy for neuromuscular maturation and life history events like locomotor onset and the achievement of an adult-like gait. This approach could significantly expand our knowledge of the biology and behavior of fossil species.",10.1111/joa.13641,35178713,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:43:14.305759-04:00,No,,

An increase in the size and number of zooarchaeological assemblages after the appearance of <i>H. erectus</i> is often offered as a central piece of archaeological evidence for increased carnivory in this species, but this characterization has yet to be subject to detailed scrutiny. Any widespread dietary shift leading to the acquisition of key traits in <i>H. erectus</i> should be persistent in the zooarchaeological record through time and can only be convincingly demonstrated by a broad-scale analysis that transcends individual sites or localities. Here, we present a quantitative synthesis of the zooarchaeological record of eastern Africa from 2.6 to 1.2 Ma. We show that several proxies for the prevalence of hominin carnivory are all strongly related to how well the fossil record has been sampled, which constrains the zooarchaeological visibility of hominin carnivory. When correcting for sampling effort, there is no sustained increase in the amount of evidence for hominin carnivory between 2.6 and 1.2 Ma.

However, until recently it was not possible to establish when, where, and how certain forms of Middle Paleolithic behavior appeared and spread into Southeastern Europe, mainly owing to gaps in the Paleolithic record. Here we report new results of dating, material culture, and the archaeological context of finds from the Balanica Cave Complex in Si&#x107;evo (Serbia). Two methods-thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance-were used to date the sequence. The geoarchaeological context was examined through sedimentology, micromorphology, and spatial analysis. Microfaunal remains were used to constrain the dates within an ecological zone, whereas macrofauna was analyzed for taxonomy and taphonomy to examine the source of accumulation and hominin behavior. Technological and typological features of the lithic assemblage were used to characterize lithic production at the site. Materials recovered from Layer 3 in Velika Balanica and from Layer 2 in Mala Balanica, both dated to MIS 9-7, include a distinctive set of archaeological assemblages which resemble contemporaneous Yabrudian assemblages from the Levant in important ways, and which are unlike contemporary material from the surrounding regions. In Velika Balanica, the lithic assemblages are associated with a large fireplace containing evidence of human activities similar to those from Qesem Cave (Israel). Dental remains uncovered in the same layer are consistent with Neanderthals. These findings suggest that the end of the Middle Pleistocene (before 300-240&#xa0;ka) saw population movement and/or cultural transmission between Southwest Asia and the Balkans, which led eventually to a transfer of technology between Middle Eastern and European hominin populations and contributed to the shaping of Neanderthal behaviors throughout the eastern and northern Mediterranean.",10.1016/j.jhevol.2021.103138,35066426,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:10:47.356652-04:00,No,,

However, the paucity of hominin remains, the lack of comparative hominoid data, and the destructive nature of many life history approaches have limited our understanding of the relationship between dental development (eruption) and weaning in primates. Alternatively, the rate of dental wear in early-forming teeth has been suggested a good proxy for the timing of weaning. Here we test this hypothesis on an ontogenetic series of Gorilla gorilla gorilla and Pan troglodytes troglodytes, using geographic information systems-based shape descriptors of M<sub>1</sub>s in relation to the nitrogen (&#x3b4;<sup>15</sup>N) and carbon (&#x3b4;<sup>13</sup>C) isotope composition of their associated hair. Results show that Gorilla g. gorilla are fully weaned considerably later than Pan t. troglodytes, that is, after M1s had been in full functional occlusion for some time. Yet, throughout ontogeny, gorilla dental wear rates are greater than they are in chimpanzees. This refutes the hypothesis that the rates of wear of early-forming teeth inform the time of weaning (i.e., nutritional independence). Instead, dietary breadth and seasonal variation in resource availability are implicated. This finding has implications for interpreting the hominin fossil record and raises questions about the triggers for, and the mechanisms of, life history change in hominin evolution. As a case in point, commonalities in life history patterns between early hominins and Western lowland gorillas seem to be a means to mitigate the effects of recurrent (i.e., seasonal) resource limitations and-conceivably-to prevent high infant mortality rates. Taken further, difference between hominid life histories are likely to be of degree, not kind.",10.1016/j.jhevol.2021.103126,34954400,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:40:00.198738-04:00,No,,

Ultra-high resolution radiocarbon determinations suggest that the cave was occupied seasonally by Magdalenian hunters for perhaps no more than two or three human generations, centred on 12,600 BP (~14,950-14,750 cal BP). They left behind a rich and diverse assemblage of Magdalenian lithic and osseous artefacts, butchered animal bones, and cannibalised human remains. The faunal assemblage from Gough's Cave is one of the most comprehensively studied from any Magdalenian site, yet new and unexpected discoveries continue to be made. Here, we record previously unrecognized flint-knapping tools that were identified during a survey of the Gough's Cave faunal collection at the Natural History Museum (London). We identified bones used as hammers and teeth manipulated as pressure-flakers to manufacture flint tools. Most of the pieces appear to be ad hoc (single-use?) tools, but a horse molar was almost certainly a curated object that was used over an extended period to work many stone tools. This paper explores how these knapping tools were used to support a more nuanced understanding of Magdalenian stone-tool manufacturing processes.

First, herding and livestock, likely of East African origin, appeared in southern Africa, preceding the arrival of the large-scale Bantu-speaking agro-pastoralist expansion that introduced West African-related genetic ancestry into the area. Present-day Khoekhoe-speaking Namaqua (or Nama in short) pastoralists show high proportions of East African admixture, linking the East African ancestry with Khoekhoe herders. Most other historical Khoekhoe populations have, however, disappeared over the last few centuries and their contribution to the genetic structure of present-day populations is not well understood. In our study, we analyzed genome-wide autosomal and full mitochondrial data from a population who trace their ancestry to the Khoekhoe-speaking Hessequa herders from the southern Cape region of what is now South Africa. We generated genome-wide data from 162 individuals and mitochondrial DNA data of a subset of 87 individuals, sampled in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, where the Hessequa population once lived. Using available comparative data from Khoe-speaking and related groups, we aligned genetic date estimates and admixture proportions to the archaeological proposed dates and routes for the arrival of the East African pastoralists in southern Africa. We identified several Afro-Asiatic-speaking pastoralist groups from Ethiopia and Tanzania who share high affinities with the East African ancestry present in southern Africa. We also found that the East African pastoralist expansion was heavily male-biased, akin to a pastoralist migration previously observed on the genetic level in ancient Europe, by which Pontic-Caspian Steppe pastoralist groups represented by the Yamnaya culture spread across the Eurasian continent during the late Neolithic/Bronze Age. We propose that pastoralism in southern Africa arrived through male-biased migration of an East African Afro-Asiatic-related group(s) who introduced new subsistence and livestock practices to local southern African hunter-gatherers.

In order to assess the weight of the counter-intuitive factor in the percussion mark pattern distribution, we carried out an experiment that by contrast focuses on the intuitive approach of fracturing bones to extract marrow, involving individual without experience in this activity. We wanted to evaluate the influence of bone morphology and the individuals' behaviour on the distribution of percussion marks. Twelve experimenters broke 120 limb bones, a series of 10 bones per individual. During the experiment, information concerning the fracture of the bones as well as individual behaviour was collected and was subsequently compared to data from the laboratory study of the remains. Then, we applied an innovative GIS (Geographic Information System) method to analyze the distribution of percussion marks to highlight recurrent patterns. Results show that in spite of all the variables there is a high similarity in the distribution of percussion marks which we consider as intuitive patterns. The factor influenced the distribution for the humerus, radius-ulna and tibia series is the bone morphology, while for the femur series individual behaviour seems to have more weight in the distribution.

Moreover, ornamental plant domestication represents an aesthetics-driven dimension of human niche construction that coevolved with socioeconomic changes and the adoption of new scientific technologies.

Although Jordan River Dureijat was occupied throughout the Epipaleolithic (~20-10 kya the fish hooks appear only at the later stage of this period (15,000-12,000 cal BP). This paper presents a multidimensional study of the hooks, grooved stones, site context, and the fish assemblage from macro and micro perspectives following technological, use wear, residue and zooarchaeological approaches. The study of the fish hooks reveals significant variability in hook size, shape and feature type and provides the first evidence that several landmark innovations in fishing technology were already in use at this early date. These include inner and outer barbs, a variety of line attachment techniques including knobs, grooves and adhesives and some of the earliest evidence for artificial lures. Wear on the grooved stones is consistent with their use as sinkers while plant fibers recovered from the grooves of one hook shank and one stone suggest the use of fishing line. This together with associations between the grooved stones and hooks in the same archaeological layers, suggests the emergence of a sophisticated line and hook technology. The complexity of this technology is highlighted by the multiple steps required to manufacture each component and combine them into an integrated system. The appearance of such technology in the Levantine Epipaleolithic record reflects a deep knowledge of fish behavior and ecology. This coincides with significant larger-scale patterns in subsistence evolution, namely broad spectrum foraging, which is an important first signal of the beginning of the transition to agriculture in this region.",10.1371/journal.pone.0257710,34613991,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:47:28.136091-04:00,No,,

Despite its long history and appearance in historical records, its origins and past dissemination patterns are still widely unknown. Applying ancient DNA approaches to its major causative agent, Mycobacterium leprae, can significantly improve our understanding of the disease's complex history. Previous studies have identified a high genetic continuity of the pathogen over the last 1500&#x2009;years and the existence of at least four M. leprae lineages in some parts of Europe since the Early Medieval period. Here, we reconstructed 19 ancient M. leprae genomes to further investigate M. leprae's genetic variation in Europe, with a dedicated focus on bacterial genomes from previously unstudied regions (Belarus, Iberia, Russia, Scotland), from multiple sites in a single region (Cambridgeshire, England), and from two Iberian leprosaria. Overall, our data confirm the existence of similar phylogeographic patterns across Europe, including high diversity in leprosaria. Further, we identified a new genotype in Belarus. By doubling the number of complete ancient M. leprae genomes, our results improve our knowledge of the past phylogeography of M. leprae and reveal a particularly high M. leprae diversity in European medieval leprosaria. Our findings allow us to detect similar patterns of strain diversity across Europe with branch 3 as the most common branch and the leprosaria as centers for high diversity. The higher resolution of our phylogeny tree also refined our understanding of the interspecies transfer between red squirrels and humans pointing to a late antique/early medieval transmission. Furthermore, with our new estimates on the past population diversity of M. leprae, we gained first insights into the disease's global history in relation to major historic events such as the Roman expansion or the beginning of the regular transatlantic long distance trade. In summary, our findings highlight how studying ancient M. leprae genomes worldwide improves our understanding of leprosy's global history and can contribute to current models of M. leprae's worldwide dissemination, including interspecies transmissions.",10.1186/s12915-021-01120-2,34610848,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:42:23.597223-04:00,No,,

Previous reports suggest that sheep breeds from Kazakhstan have an intermediate genetic composition between Asian and European breeds; however, this data appears to be limited. Therefore, we studied the genetic diversity of ancient domestic sheep from two Late Bronze Age settlements, Toksanbai and Kent, located in the Pre-Caspian region of Kazakhstan and central Kazakhstan, respectively. We have applied ZooMS analysis for taxonomic identification of small ruminant remains to select ancient specimens of domestic sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>). To assign sheep mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the control region were analyzed by real-time PCR and direct sequencing.

BDNF potentially exhibits opposite effects in the pathways linked to anhedonia and reward learning on the one hand and cognitive performance, on the other hand. However, the epigenetic mechanisms behind this remain unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the interplay of DNA methylation of different BDNF exons and the common Val66Met polymorphism on anhedonia, reward learning and cognitive performance in MDD. We recruited 80 depressed patients and 58 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Participants underwent clinical assessment including neuropsychological testing and a probabilistic reward task to assess reward learning. Val66Met polymorphism and DNA methylation of BDNF promoters I, IV and exon IX were assessed from whole blood derived DNA, using pyrosequencing. BDNF promoter I methylation was lower in MDD patients (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042) and was negatively associated with self-reported anhedonia.

Here, we present our reconstruction of oral microbiomes via shotgun metagenomics of dental calculus in 44 ancient foragers and farmers from two regions playing a pivotal role in the spread of farming across Europe-the Balkans and the Italian Peninsula.

The human oral environment in prehistory was dominated by a microbial species, Anaerolineaceae bacterium oral taxon 439, that diversified geographically. A Near Eastern lineage of this bacterial commensal dispersed with Neolithic farmers and replaced the variant present in the local foragers.

The main difficulty is related to the diagnosis of this pathology based exclusively on bone remains. In this work, we propose a metric and morphological method to discriminate flat foot in dry bones. Thus, we studied 390 pairs of adult feet in a fair state of preservation from archaeological contexts from Spain, Italy, and Oman. Morphological variability, angles, and dimensions of both the normal bones and the bones displaying flat foot characteristics were analyzed. We found a correlation between the presence of flat foot and some morphological and metric features, mainly in the subtalar and Chopart joints. These results are expressed through a combination of morphological and metric variables, which are useful to discriminate between these two groups. No markedly significant differences of flat foot frequencies between the Spanish and Italian series were found across centuries. However, we noticed a notable increase of the prevalence of flat foot in the contemporary collection, possibly due to the consequences of a rise in life expectancy and modern styles of footwear.",10.1127/homo/2021/1320,34296244,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 18:07:53.726365-04:00,No,,

Two contrasting assemblages were analysed for pathological and sub-pathological changes: 1) an assemblage of domestic modern rabbit bones; and 2) a non-anthropogenic accumulation of archaeological rabbit remains. The lesions observed macroscopically, under magnification, and radiographically in both assemblages are quantified and described. In the first assemblage, pathological and sub-pathological changes mostly affected the lower limb bones and primarily took two forms: diaphyseal periosteal proliferation and hypervascularised distal physes. Differential diagnosis of the periosteal proliferation suggests that pododermatitis is the most probable cause. In the second assemblage fractures were the most common lesions, but isolated examples of hypervascularised physes, periosteal proliferation, and musculo-skeletal stress markers were also identified. The pathological changes recorded is typical of a naturally-accumulated population of wild rabbits. The prevalence of pathological and sub-pathological skeletal changes in the rabbits, and thus their health status, are closely related to living conditions. This study demonstrates the value of systematically recording pathologies in rabbit bones. We contribute new data to help understand rabbit interactions with humans in the past and also the environment they inhabited.

To stem this public-health crisis, the WHO recommends a standard continuity of maternal healthcare, yet most women do not receive this care. Surveys suggest that illiteracy limits the uptake of the recommended care, yet little is understood about why this is so. This gap in understanding why healthcare is not sought by illiterate women compromises the ability of public health experts and healthcare providers to provide culturally relevant policy and practice. This study consequently explores the lived experiences related to care-seeking by illiterate women of reproductive age in rural Tanzania to determine why they may not access maternal healthcare services. An exploratory, qualitative study was conducted in four communities encompassing eight focus group discussions with 81 illiterate women, 13 in-depth interviews with illiterate women and seven key-informant interviews with members of these communities who have first-hand experience with the decisions made by women concerning maternal care. Interviews were conducted in the informant's native language. The interviews were coded, then triangulated. Two themes emerged from the analysis: 1) a communication gap arising from a) the women's inability to read public-health documents provided by health facilities, and b) healthcare providers speaking a language, Swahili, that these women do not understand, and 2) a dependency by these women on family and neighbors to negotiate these barriers. Notably, these women understood of the potential benefits of maternal healthcare. These women knew they should receive maternal healthcare but could neither read the public-health messaging provided by the clinics nor understand the language of the healthcare providers. More health needs of this group could be met by developing a protocol for healthcare providers to determine who is illiterate, providing translation services for those unable to speak Swahili, and graphic public health messaging that does not require literacy. A failure to address the needs of this at-risk group will likely mean that they will continue to experience barriers to obtaining maternal care with detrimental health outcomes for both mothers and newborns.",10.1186/s12884-021-03906-2,34182949,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:36:38.104538-04:00,No,,

This leads to the paradoxical task of planning paleontological campaigns without knowing the true extent and likely potential of each fossil site and, hence, how to optimize the investment of time and resources. Yet to answer key questions in hominin evolution, paleoanthropologists must engage in fieldwork that targets substantial temporal and geographical gaps in the fossil record. How can the risk of potentially unsuccessful surveys be minimized, while maximizing the potential for successful surveys? Here we present a simple and effective solution for finding fossil sites based on clustering by unsupervised learning of satellite images with the <i>k</i>-means algorithm and pioneer its testing in the Urema Rift, the southern termination of the East African Rift System (EARS). We focus on a relatively unknown time period critical for understanding African apes and early hominin evolution, the early part of the late Miocene, in an overlooked area of southeastern Africa, in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique. This clustering approach highlighted priority targets for prospecting that represented only 4.49% of the total area analysed. Applying this method, four new fossil sites were discovered in the area, and results show an 85% accuracy in a binary classification. This indicates the high potential of a remote sensing tool for exploratory paleontological surveys by enhancing the discovery of productive fossiliferous deposits. The relative importance of spectral bands for clustering was also determined using the random forest algorithm, and near-infrared was the most important variable for fossil site detection, followed by other infrared variables. Bands in the visible spectrum performed the worst and are not likely indicators of fossil sites. We show that unsupervised learning is a useful tool for locating new fossil sites in relatively unexplored regions. Additionally, it can be used to target specific gaps in the fossil record and to increase the sample of fossil sites. In Gorongosa, the discovery of the first estuarine coastal forests of the EARS fills an important paleobiogeographic gap of Africa. These new sites will be key for testing hypotheses of primate evolution in such environmental settings.",10.7717/peerj.11573,34164235,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:03:01.531266-04:00,No,,

Fifteen traits were used to explore morphological affinities among series through Euclidean distance, Mean Measure of Divergence, and Principal Component Analysis.

Morphological affinities show that ceramic and nonceramic South Coast groups cluster and differ from most Southeast series. In contrast, Southeast coastal and riverine groups display high morphological variance, showing less biological coherence among them. These biological distances between regions are partially explained by geography, but not by chronology. The results support that these coastal populations were low-mobility groups. Although interactions between individuals of different regions likely existed, gene flow occurred mostly among individuals from local or adjacent areas.

This complex monument, comprising two super-imposed tanks, is generally linked with an important but uncertain ritual role involving water. The context provides extraordinary preservation of both wooden, other organic, and cultural finds.

The long history of medicinal cannabis use contrasts with the paucity of archaeobotanical records. Moreover, physical evidence of medicinal cannabis use in a secular context is much rarer than evidence of medicinal cannabis use in religious or ritual activities, which impedes our understanding of the history of medicinal cannabis use. This study aims to provide archaeobotanical evidence of medicinal cannabis use and analyse the specific medicinal usage of cannabis in a secular context in ancient times. Plant remains were collected from the Laoguanshan Cemetery of the Han Dynasty in Chengdu, South China, with the archaeological flotation process and were identified based on morphological and anatomical characteristics. The examination of the medicinal significance of the remains relied on the investigation of the documentation on unearthed medical bamboo slips, the diseases of the tomb occupants, the cemetery's cultural background and Chinese historical records. The botanical remains were accurately identified as cannabis. More than 120 thousand fruits were found, which represents the largest amount of cannabis fruit remains that have been statistically analysed from any cemetery in the world thus far. The cannabis fruits are suspected to have been used for medical purposes in a secular context and were most likely used to stop severe bleeding of the uterus and treat lumbago and/or arthralgia. The cannabis fruit remains reported here likely represent the first physical evidence of medicinal cannabis use for the treatment of metrorrhagia, severe lumbago, and/or arthralgia.

However, contamination imposes a major concern for paleomicrobiological samples due to their low endogenous DNA content and exposure to environmental sources, calling into question some published results. Decontamination protocols (e.g. an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) pre-digestion or ultraviolet radiation (UV) and 5% sodium hypochlorite immersion treatments) aim to minimize the exogenous content of the outer surface of ancient calculus samples prior to DNA extraction. While these protocols are widely used, no one has systematically compared them in ancient dental calculus. Here, we compare untreated dental calculus samples to samples from the same site treated with four previously published decontamination protocols: a UV only treatment; a 5% sodium hypochlorite immersion treatment; a pre-digestion in EDTA treatment; and a combined UV irradiation and 5% sodium hypochlorite immersion treatment. We examine their efficacy in ancient oral microbiota recovery by applying 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun sequencing, identifying ancient oral microbiota, as well as soil and skin contaminant species. Overall, the EDTA pre-digestion and a combined UV irradiation and 5% sodium hypochlorite immersion treatment were both effective at reducing the proportion of environmental taxa and increasing oral taxa in comparison to untreated samples.

The specimen was born in captivity at London Zoo (Zoological Society of London), then in the 1970s transferred to Kiev Zoo (Peremohy Avenue), Ukraine, and was kept there until it died at a documented chronological age of 48 years. The female died because of its age, which indicates it was kept in good conditions adequate to the requirements of this species. Photographs and micrographs with radiological documentation were taken on the said tooth. Its structural characteristics were determined, and on the occlusal surface areas and points of anatomical constitution of its crown were identified. The tooth was also histologically evaluated via sections taken horizontally in a mesial-distal plane through the crown, horizontally in a mesial-distal plane through the coronal portion of the root, and longitudinally in a lingual-buccal plane through the crown and the root. Preparations with ground sections were made and observed in white, polarized, and reflected light. In the subsequent stage X-ray and SEM imaging has also been used, for analysis of the distribution of annual growth layers of mineralized dental tissues of cement and dentine, counted from the root canal center to the buccal surface. An attempt was also made to confirm the annual season in which the animal died, based on cement growth lines. It was observed that the growth lines were visible in all the analyzed sections, in dentine and cement. In the cement, the lines were relatively few and did not represent the attested age of the animal. The analysis of the coloration of the cement lines indicated that the animal was regularly fed a diet that was not seasonally differentiated. From the X-ray examination comes a conclusion that the animal did not suffer from periodontal diseases. Visible growth lines were observed on the dentine. On the horizontal section through the crown growth lines in the dentine were few and unclear. On the longitudinal section, both on the caudal and rostral roots, these lines were clearly visible and much more numerous than expected considering the known age of the animal, as more than 50 were counted. On horizontal sections through the upper part of both roots, distinct growth lines were observed in the dentine, and their number-48 for both roots-corresponded precisely to the age of the animal.

These considerations are exemplified by the discussion of abundant new archaeobotanical data from the Late Bronze Age copper mining site of Prigglitz-Gasteil, situated at the easternmost fringe of the Alps. At this site, copper ore mining in opencast mines took place from the 11th until the 9th century BCE (late Urnfield Culture), as well as copper processing (beneficiation, smelting, refining, casting) on artificial terrain terraces. During archaeological excavations from 2010 to 2014, two areas of the site were investigated and sampled for archaeobotanical finds and micro-debris in a high-resolution approach. This paper aims at 1) analysing the food plant spectrum at the mining settlement of Prigglitz-Gasteil basing on charred plant macroremains, 2) investigating producer/consumer aspects of Prigglitz-Gasteil in comparison to the Bronze Age metallurgical sites of Kiechlberg, Klinglberg, and Mauken, and 3) reconstructing the miners' and metallurgists' diets. Our analyses demonstrate that the plant-based diet of the investigated mining communities reflects the general regional and chronological trends rather than particular preferences of the miners or metallurgists. The lack of chaff, combined with a high occurrence of processed food, suggests that the miners at Prigglitz-Gasteil were supplied from outside with ready-to-cook and processed grain, either from adjacent communities or from a larger distance. This consumer character is in accordance with observation from previously analysed metallurgical sites. Interestingly, the components observed in charred cereal products (barley, Hordeum vulgare, and foxtail millet, Setaria italica) contrast with the dominant crop taxa (broomcorn millet, Panicum miliaceum, foxtail millet, and lentil, Lens culinaris).

For archaeological contexts, variation in house size reflects differences in labor investments and serves as a robust means to assess wealth across populations small and large. The Gini coefficient, which measures the degree of concentration in the distribution of units within a population, has been employed as a standardized metric to evaluate the extent of inequality. Here, we employ Gini coefficients to assess wealth inequality at four nested socio-spatial scales-the micro-region, the polity, the district, and the neighborhood-at two medium size, peripheral Classic Maya polities located in southern Belize. We then compare our findings to Gini coefficients for other Classic Maya polities in the Maya heartland and to contemporaneous polities across Mesoamerica. We see the patterning of wealth inequality across the polities as a consequence of variable access to networks of exchange. Different forms of governance played a role in the degree of wealth inequality in Mesoamerica. More autocratic Classic Maya polities, where principals exercised degrees of control over exclusionary exchange networks, maintained high degrees of wealth inequality compared to most other Mesoamerican states, which generally are characterized by more collective forms of governance. We examine how household wealth inequality was reproduced at peripheral Classic Maya polities, and illustrate that economic inequity trickled down to local socio-spatial units in this prehispanic context.",10.1371/journal.pone.0248169,33760835,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 01:08:53.321862-04:00,No,,

Here we use a global dataset of rock art sites and climate and genetics-based estimates of ancient population densities to test a new model based on epidemiological principles. The model focuses on the process whereby a cultural innovation becomes endemic in a population, predicting that this cannot occur unless population density exceeds a critical threshold. Analysis of the data, using a Bayesian statistical framework, shows that the model has stronger empirical support than a proportional model, where detection is directly proportional to population density, or a null model, where rock art detection ratios and population density are independent. Results for different geographical areas and periods are compatible with the predictions of the model and confirm its superiority with respect to the null model. Re-analysis of the rock art data, using a second set of independent population estimates, again supports the superiority of the model. Although the available data is sparse and the analysis cannot exclude all possible sources of bias, this is evidence that population density above a critical threshold may be a necessary condition for the maintenance of rock art as a stable part of a population's cultural repertoire.

Their global explosion, representing one of the greatest adaptive radiations in mammalian history, is largely attributed to their ability of laryngeal echolocation and powered flight, which enabled them to conquer the night sky, a vast and hitherto unoccupied ecological niche. While there is consensus that powered flight evolved only once in the lineage, whether laryngeal echolocation has a single origin in bats or evolved multiple times independently remains disputed. Here, we present developmental evidence in support of laryngeal echolocation having multiple origins in bats. This is consistent with a non-echolocating bat ancestor and independent gain of echolocation in Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, as well as the gain of primitive echolocation in the bat ancestor, followed by convergent evolution of laryngeal echolocation in Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, with loss of primitive echolocation in pteropodids. Our comparative embryological investigations found that there is no developmental difference in the hearing apparatus between non-laryngeal echolocating bats (pteropodids) and terrestrial non-bat mammals.

While the proposed causes for megafaunal extinction are varied, most researchers fall into three broad camps emphasizing human overhunting, climate change, or some combination of the two. Understanding the cause of megafaunal extinctions requires the analysis of through-time relationships between climate change and megafauna and human population dynamics. To do so, many researchers have used summed probability density functions (SPDFs) as a proxy for through-time fluctuations in human and megafauna population sizes. SPDFs, however, conflate process variation with the chronological uncertainty inherent in radiocarbon dates. Recently, a new Bayesian regression technique was developed that overcomes this problem-Radiocarbon-dated Event-Count (REC) Modelling.

Subterranean fauna and microbes are crucial in regulating organic cycles in environments characterized by low energy and scarce carbon availability. However, our knowledge about the functioning of groundwater ecosystems is limited, despite being increasingly exposed to anthropic impacts and climate change-related processes. In this work we apply novel biochemical and genetic techniques to investigate the ecological dynamics of an Australian calcrete under two contrasting rainfall periods (LR-low rainfall and HR-high rainfall). Our results indicate that the microbial gut community of copepods and amphipods experienced a shift in taxonomic diversity and predicted organic functional metabolic pathways during HR. The HR regime triggered a cascade effect driven by microbes (OM processors) and exploited by copepods and amphipods (primary and secondary consumers), which was finally transferred to the aquatic beetles (top predators). Our findings highlight that rainfall triggers ecological shifts towards more deterministic dynamics, revealing a complex web of interactions in seemingly simple environmental settings. Here we show how a combined isotopic-molecular approach can untangle the mechanisms shaping a calcrete community. This design will help manage and preserve one of the most vital but underrated ecosystems worldwide.",10.1038/s41598-021-83286-x,33580159,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 14:54:10.343674-04:00,No,,

We use a participatory modelling tool, Kesho, to assess the biophysical, socioeconomic, cultural and governance factors that influenced past (1959-1999) and present (2000-2018) LULCC in northern Tanzania and to simulate four scenarios of land cover change to the year 2030. Simulations of the scenarios used spatial modelling to integrate stakeholders' perceptions of future environmental change with social and environmental data on recent trends in LULCC. From stakeholders' perspectives, between 1959 and 2018, LULCC was influenced by climate variability, availability of natural resources, agriculture expansion, urbanization, tourism growth and legislation governing land access and natural resource management. Among other socio-environmental-political LULCC drivers, the stakeholders envisioned that from 2018 to 2030 LULCC will largely be influenced by land health, natural and economic capital, and political will in implementing land use plans and policies. The projected scenarios suggest that by 2030 agricultural land will have expanded by 8-20% under different scenarios and herbaceous vegetation and forest land cover will be reduced by 2.5-5% and 10-19% respectively. Stakeholder discussions further identified desirable futures in 2030 as those with improved infrastructure, restored degraded landscapes, effective wildlife conservation, and better farming techniques. The undesirable futures in 2030 were those characterized by land degradation, poverty, and cultural loss. Insights from our work identify the implications of future LULCC scenarios on wildlife and cultural conservation and in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets by 2030.

In 2018-20, a research project focusing on the study of the site was realized. Magnetometer survey became an integral part of the project since it represented a way to obtain an overall image of the site. A 5-channel fluxgate gradiometer from Sensys (Germany) was used; the vertical gradient of the Z component of the Earth magnetic field was measured.

Despite consensus that the late Miocene dryopith great apes <i>Hispanopithecus laietanus</i> (Spain) and <i>Rudapithecus hungaricus</i> (Hungary) are closely related (Hominidae), ongoing debate on their phylogenetic relationships with extant apes (stem hominids, hominines, or pongines) complicates our understanding of great ape and human evolution. To clarify this question, we rely on the morphology of the inner ear semicircular canals, which has been shown to be phylogenetically informative. Based on microcomputed tomography scans, we describe the vestibular morphology of <i>Hispanopithecus</i> and <i>Rudapithecus</i>, and compare them with extant hominoids using landmark-free deformation-based three-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses. We also provide critical evidence about the evolutionary patterns of the vestibular apparatus in living and fossil hominoids under different phylogenetic assumptions for dryopiths. Our results are consistent with the distinction of <i>Rudapithecus</i> and <i>Hispanopithecus</i> at the genus rank, and further support their allocation to the Hominidae based on their derived semicircular canal volumetric proportions. Compared with extant hominids, the vestibular morphology of <i>Hispanopithecus</i> and <i>Rudapithecus</i> most closely resembles that of African apes, and differs from the derived condition of orangutans. However, the vestibular morphologies reconstructed for the last common ancestors of dryopiths, crown hominines, and crown hominids are very similar, indicating that hominines are plesiomorphic in this regard.

Our results show selective use of legume crop progenitors and nuts during the earlier part of this period, followed by the management of cereal and legume crop progenitors from the mid-11th millennium cal BP. This contrasts with data available from other Anatolian habitations indicating broad spectrum plant use with low crop progenitor inputs. Early aceramic Neolithic Anatolian plant and animal exploitation strategies were site-specific, reflecting distinctive identities and culinary choices rather than environmental constraints. A multivariate evaluation of wheat grain metrics alongside botanical and radiometric data indicate that early wheat domestication in southeast Anatolia occurred at a faster pace than predicted by current hypotheses for a protracted transition to farming in Southwest Asia.

While an advanced fishery is suggested by the number of recovered fish bones, until now it has not been possible to identify the origin of the fish, or whether and how their seasonal migration was exploited. We analysed strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) in 16 cyprinid and 8 pike teeth, which were recovered at the site, both from within the fermentation pit and from different areas outside of it, by using laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our investigation indicates three different regions of origin for the fish at the site. We find that the most commonly fermented fish, cyprinids (roach), were caught in the autumn during their seasonal migration from the Baltic Sea to the sheltered stream and lake next to the site. This is in contrast to the cyprinids from other areas of the site, which were caught when migrating from nearby estuaries and the Baltic Sea coast during late spring. The pikes from the fermentation pit were caught in the autumn as by-catch to the mainly targeted roach while moving from the nearby Baltic Sea coast. Lastly, the pikes from outside the fermentation pit were likely caught as they migrated from nearby waters in sedimentary bedrock areas to the south of the site, to spawn in early spring. Combined, these data suggest an advanced fishery with the ability to combine optimal use of seasonal fish abundance at different times of the year.

We analyzed population genomic data of all five snub-nosed monkey species to assess their genetic diversity, inbreeding level, and genetic load. For <i>R. roxellana, R. bieti</i>, and <i>R. strykeri</i>, population size is positively correlated with genetic diversity and negatively correlated with levels of inbreeding. Other species, however, which possess small population sizes, such as <i>R. brelichi</i> and <i>R. avunculus</i>, show high levels of genetic diversity and low levels of genomic inbreeding. Similarly, in the three populations of <i>R. roxellana</i>, the Shennongjia population, which possesses the lowest population size, displays a higher level of genetic diversity and lower level of genomic inbreeding. These findings suggest that although <i>R. brelichi</i> and <i>R. avunculus</i> and the Shennongjia population might be at risk, it possess significant genetic diversity and could thus help strengthen their long-term survival potential. Intriguingly, <i>R. roxellana</i> with large population size possess high genetic diversity and low level of genetic load, but they show the highest recent inbreeding level compared with the other snub-nosed monkeys. This suggests that, despite its large population size, <i>R. roxellana</i> has likely been experiencing recent inbreeding, which has not yet affected its mutational load and fitness. Analyses of homozygous-derived deleterious mutations identified in all snub-nosed monkey species indicate that these mutations are affecting immune, especially in smaller population sizes, indicating that the long-term consequences of inbreeding may be resulting in an overall reduction of immune capability in the snub-nosed monkeys, which could provide a dramatic effect on their long-term survival prospects.

A striking observation is that the manufacture of these pendants is similar in all burials. Teeth were worked by carving one or several grooves around the root tip. In addition to grooved ones, a number of teeth were not worked at all. The uniformity of the chosen species, tooth and techniques indicates that strict norms prevailed in the pendant industry. Despite the overall similarity, our study shows some variation in making pendants. A groove can cut the whole circumference of the root, or several distinct grooves can mark opposite sides of the root. Sometimes the grooves are deep and made carefully, and sometimes they are weak and made hastily. A typology of various groove types was created. In many graves, one groove type dominates. We interpret that this inter-burial variation and domination of one type resulted from personal choice and taste based on practicality. Such variation could also be associated with kin identifiers, but we did not find clear support for that in our study. Our study indicates that the groove types as such had no connection with particular ornaments, garments or hanging positions.",10.1007/s12520-020-01237-5,33343760,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:12:39.689694-04:00,No,,

However, cultural reconstructions have often focused on a restricted region of Europe, namely the northern Aquitaine Basin. The Mediterranean Basin, though, is also a region worthy of consideration when testing if the Protoaurignacian was followed by the Early Aurignacian adaptive system. Fumane Cave is a pivotal site for tackling this issue because it contains evidence of repeated human occupations during the time span of the European Aurignacian. Here we investigate the diachronic variability of the lithic assemblages from five cultural units at Fumane Cave using a combination of reduction sequence and attribute analyses. This paper also reassesses the presence and stratigraphic reliability of the organic artifacts recovered at Fumane Cave. Our results show that the features of the Protoaurignacian techno-typology are present throughout the stratigraphic sequence, and by extension, to the onset of Heinrich Event 4.

Here we re-evaluate this latter proposition, using published information and new comparative data. Although both StW 573 and StW 431 are apparently comparable in their arboreal (i.e., climbing) and bipedal adaptations, they also show significant morphological differences. Surprisingly, StW 431 cannot be unequivocally aligned with either StW 573 or other hominins from Sterkfontein commonly attributed to A. africanus (nor with Paranthropus robustus and Australopithecus sediba). This finding, together with considerations about the recent dating of Plio-Pleistocene hominin-bearing sites in South Africa and palaeoecological/palaeoclimatic conditions, raises questions whether it is justified to subsume hominins from Taung, Makapansgat and Sterkfontein (and Gladysvale) within a single taxon.

Its persistence in the environment relies on the subtle balance between <i>Y. pestis</i>-contaminated soils, burrowing and nonburrowing mammals exhibiting variable degrees of plague susceptibility, and their associated fleas. Transmission from one host to another relies mainly on infected flea bites, inducing typical painful, enlarged lymph nodes referred to as buboes, followed by septicemic dissemination of the pathogen. In contrast, droplet inhalation after close contact with infected mammals induces primary pneumonic plague. Finally, the rarely reported consumption of contaminated raw meat causes pharyngeal and gastrointestinal plague. Point-of-care diagnosis, early antibiotic treatment, and confinement measures contribute to outbreak control despite residual mortality. Mandatory primary prevention relies on the active surveillance of established plague foci and ectoparasite control. Plague is acknowledged to have infected human populations for at least 5,000&#x2009;years in Eurasia. <i>Y. pestis</i> genomes recovered from affected archaeological sites have suggested clonal evolution from a common ancestor shared with the closely related enteric pathogen <i>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</i> and have indicated that <i>ymt</i> gene acquisition during the Bronze Age conferred <i>Y. pestis</i> with ectoparasite transmissibility while maintaining its enteric transmissibility.

Much work in urban science is animated by the notion that cities are complex systems. What does it mean to make this claim? Here we adopt the view that complex systems entail both variation and structure, and that their properties vary with system size and with respect to where and how they are measured. Given this, a general framework regarding the social processes behind urbanization needs to account for empirical regularities that are common to both contemporary cities and past settlements known through archaeology and history. Only by adopting an explicitly historical perspective can such fundamental structure be revealed. The identification of shared properties in past and present systems has been facilitated by research traditions that define cities (and settlements more broadly) as networks of social interaction embedded in physical space. Settlement Scaling Theory (SST) builds from these insights to generate predictions regarding how measurable properties of cities and settlements are related to their population size. Here, we focus on relationships between population and area across past settlement systems and present-day world cities. We show that both patterns and variations in these measures are explicable in terms of SST, and that the framework identifies baseline infrastructural area as an important system-level property of urban systems that warrants further study.

Disentangling the effects of different processes and stressors is challenging due to their interconnected nature. However, as protected areas (i.e. national parks) are less anthropogenically impacted, they are ideal for investigating single stressors. We focus on the Bavarian Forest National Park, a Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in Germany, where the major stressors are climate warming, air pollution (i.e. acidification) and bark beetle infestations. We investigated the effects of these stressors on freshwater macroinvertebrates using comprehensive long-term (1983-2014) datasets comprising high-resolution macroinvertebrate and physico-chemical data from a near-natural stream. Macroinvertebrate communities have undergone substantial changes over the past 32&#xa0;years, highlighted by increases in overall community abundance (+173%) and richness (+51.6%) as well as taxonomic restructuring driven by a disproportional increase of dipterans. Prior to the year 2000, regression analyses revealed a decline in sulphate deposition and subsequent recovery from historical acidification as potential drivers of the increases in abundance and richness rather than to increases in water temperature (1.5&#xa0;&#xb0;C overall increase). Post 2000, however, alterations to nutrient cycling caused by bark beetle infestations coupled with warming temperatures were correlated to taxonomic restructuring and disproportional increases of dipterans at the expense of sensitive taxa such as plecopterans and trichopterans. Our results highlight the challenges when investigating the effects of climate change within a multi-stressor context. Even in conservation areas, recovery from previous disturbance might mask the effects of ongoing disturbances like climate change. Overall, we observed strong community restructuring, demonstrating that stenothermal headwater communities face additional stress due to emerging competition with tolerant taxa.

Those interested in the demography of the distant past are not so fortunate, given the lack of written records. Nevertheless, the emergence in recent years of a new interest in the demography of ancient populations has seen the development of a range of new methods for piecing together archaeological, skeletal and DNA evidence to reconstruct past population patterns. These efforts have found evidence in support of the view that the relatively low long-term population growth rates of prehistoric human populations, albeit ultimately conditioned by carrying capacities, may have been owing to 'boom-bust' cycles at the regional level; rapid population growth, followed by population decline. In fact, this archaeological research may have come to the same conclusion as some contemporary demographers: that demography can be remarkably hard to predict, at least in the short term. It also fits with evidence from biology that primates, and particularly humans, may be adapted to environmental variability, leading to associated demographic stochasticity.

Reconstructing such changes over long periods is difficult due to limited data availability. We collected information spanning 215&#xa0;years on fish and selected macroinvertebrate groups (Mollusca and Crustacea) in the inner-Florentine stretch of the Arno River (Italy) and associated water grid, to investigate temporal changes. We identified an almost complete turnover from native to non-native fish (1800: 92% native; 2015: 94% non-native species) and macroinvertebrate species (1800: 100% native; 2015: 70% non-native species). Non-native fish species were observed ~50&#xa0;years earlier compared to macroinvertebrate species, indicating phased invasion processes. In contrast, &#x3b1;-diversity of both communities increased significantly following a linear pattern. Separate analyses of changes in &#x3b1;-diversities for native and non-native species of both fish and macroinvertebrates were nonlinear. Functional richness and divergence of fish and macroinvertebrate communities decreased non-significantly, as the loss of native species was compensated by non-native species. Introductions of non-native fish and macroinvertebrate species occurred outside the niche space of native species. Native and non-native fish species exhibited greater overlap in niche space over time (62%-68%) and non-native species eventually replaced native species. Native and non-native macroinvertebrate niches overlapped to a lesser extent (15%-30%), with non-natives occupying mostly unoccupied niche space. These temporal changes in niche spaces of both biotic groups are a direct response to the observed changes in &#x3b1;-diversity and species turnover. These changes are potentially driven by deteriorations in hydromorphology as indicated by alterations in trait modalities. Additionally, we identified that angling played a considerable role for fish introductions. Our results support previous findings that the community turnover from native to non-native species can be facilitated by, for example, deteriorating environmental conditions and that variations in communities are multifaceted requiring more indicators than single metrics.",10.1111/gcb.15442,33159701,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:50:14.458765-04:00,No,,

Previous mitochondrial DNA phylogenies suggested that it was a highly divergent sister lineage to all extant cat species [6-8]. However, mitochondrial phylogenies can be misled by hybridization [9], incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), or sex-biased dispersal patterns [10], which might be especially relevant for Homotherium since widespread mito-nuclear discrepancies have been uncovered in modern cats [10].

Several domestication centers have been hypothesized, but most of these have been invalidated through recent paleogenetic studies. Anatolia is a region with an extended history of horse exploitation that has been considered a candidate for the origins of domestic horses but has never been subject to detailed investigation. Our paleogenetic study of pre- and protohistoric horses in Anatolia and the Caucasus, based on a diachronic sample from the early Neolithic to the Iron Age (~8000 to ~1000 BCE) that encompasses the presumed transition from wild to domestic horses (4000 to 3000 BCE), shows the rapid and large-scale introduction of domestic horses at the end of the third millennium BCE.

For the first-centuries CE, a period of political turmoil in Northern China and Southern Siberia, relatively few data are, however, available about the degree and variability of violence in these communities. Here, we provide new data on violence among steppe nomads during the first-centuries CE by analyzing the type, anatomical distribution, and demographic distribution of perimortem trauma at Tunnug1 (Tuva, Southern Siberia-second to fourth c. CE). Perimortem traumas were assessed on 87 individuals representing both sexes and different age classes. The timing of the lesions was assessed based on morphological criteria, including the absence and presence of bone reactive processes and the relative plasticity of the bone at the moment of impact. The distribution by age, sex, and anatomical location of trauma was analyzed by means of logistic models, Fisher's exact tests, and 3D visualizations. A total of 130 perimortem traumas, including chop marks, slice marks, penetrating lesions, and blunt traumas were identified on 22 individuals. Chop marks were mostly at the level of the skull and vertebrae and were likely caused by bladed weapons. Slice marks were found on the cervical vertebrae and cranium and may be the result of throat slitting and scalping by means of smaller bladed implements. Traumas were more frequent in males, and their presence is not correlated with age. This study adds new data to the few available regarding violence among steppe nomadic cultures and provides new insights about the effects of political instability on the life of the people inhabiting Eastern Eurasia during the early centuries CE.",10.1002/ajpa.24142,32935864,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:37:25.791904-04:00,No,,

This could potentially lead to a major loss of wooden artefacts that are still buried within the region. Here, we carry out the first large-scale investigation of wood degradation within archaeological deposits in the Arctic. This is done based on wooden samples from 11 archaeological sites that are located along a climatic gradient in Western Greenland. Our results show that Ascomycota fungi are causing extensive soft rot decay at all sites regardless of climate and local environment, but the group is diverse and many of the species&#xa0;were only found once. Cadophora species known to cause soft rot in polar environments were the most abundant Ascomycota found and their occurrence in native wood samples underlines that they are present locally. Basidiomycota fungi were also present at all sites. In the majority of samples, however, these aggressive and potentially very damaging wood degraders have caused limited decay so far, probably due to unfavorable growth conditions. The presence of these wood degrading fungi suggests that archaeological wooden artefacts may become further endangered if climate change leads to more favorable growth conditions.",10.1038/s41598-020-71518-5,32884059,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:31:17.993086-04:00,No,,

This challenge is made more difficult by the traditional disciplinary assumptions built into prehistoric art studies, for instance focusing narrowly upon a single body of art in isolation. This paper proposes an alternative approach, using comparative study to reveal broad regional changes in visual culture. Although prehistoric art specialists rarely work comparatively, art historians are familiar with describing continent-wide general developments in visual culture and placing them in social context (for instance, the traditional broad-brush history from Classical to medieval to Renaissance systems of representation). This paper does the same for Neolithic (6000-2500 BC) vs. Bronze Age (2500-800 BC) and Iron Age (800 BC-Classical) rock and cave art from sites across Europe, uncovering broad patterns of change. The principal pattern is a shift from a Neolithic iconic art which uses heavily encoded imagery, often schematic geometric motifs, to a Bronze/Iron Age narrative art, which increasingly involves imagery of identifiable people, animals and objects. Moreover, there is also an increasing tendency for motifs to be associated in scenes rather than purely accumulative, and with contextual changes in how art is used-a movement from hidden places to more open or accessible places. Underlying all these changes is a shift in how rock and cave art was used, from citations reproducing ritual knowledge to composed arrays telling narratives of personhood.""",10.1007/s10816-020-09471-w,32879588,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 18:15:44.629948-04:00,No,,

Therefore, this study investigated the effects of neutralisation and explosion on latent fingerprints and touch DNA. In a majority of the cases, comparative fingermark- and DNA testing resulted in individualisation. In some cases, despite extremely low amounts of contact DNA detected after deployment of render-safe tools or detonation, full STR profiles could be constituted, even after applying fingerprint development techniques.

We provide archaeobotanical evidence from trash mounds at three sites in the central Negev Desert, Israel, unraveling the rise and fall of viticulture over the second to eighth centuries of the common era (CE). Using quantitative ceramic data obtained in the same archaeological contexts, we further investigate connections between Negev viticulture and circum-Mediterranean trade. Our findings demonstrate interrelated growth in viticulture and involvement in Mediterranean trade reaching what appears to be a commercial scale in the fourth to mid-sixth centuries. Following a mid-sixth century peak, decline of this system is evident in the mid- to late sixth century, nearly a century before the Islamic conquest. These findings closely correspond with other archaeological evidence for social, economic, and urban growth in the fourth century and decline centered on the mid-sixth century. Contracting markets were a likely proximate cause for the decline; possible triggers include climate change, plague, and wider sociopolitical developments.

Males in the labor group present the highest percentage in Schmorl's nodes (13.1%) and osteophytes, whilst housekeepers exhibit the highest rate in spinal facet remodeling (45.8%). As expected, male laborers actually do present a more intense physical activity than those of the non-labor one, while this study confirmed that housekeepers do comprise a physically stressed occupational group. Spinal facet remodeling and Schmorl's nodes seem to be the least affected indicators by the factor of age, and thus are cautiously proposed as markers of physical activity in modern reference collections. Our study supports the significance of examining the current markers and especially spinal facet remodeling, in a modern skeletal collection with documented occupations and hopes to encourage more researchers to further explore the potential merit of exploring occupational stress through spinal plastic and degenerative change in identified skeletal collections.",10.1127/homo/2020/1238,32588019,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:43:24.507048-04:00,No,,

However, specific consideration of the etiologies and demographic distributions of individual skeletal indicators can inform the criteria on which to differentiate stress, frailty, and resilience. Adopting a life history approach and adaptive plasticity model, this study proposes a framework for the analysis and interpretation of a commonly reported skeletal lesion, cribra orbitalia, which considers the underlying mechanisms of the condition, the clinical and epidemiological literature relating to anemia and malnutrition, and the bioarcheological evidence. Data were extracted from the European (n = 33 populations) and American (n = 19 populations) modules of the Global History of Health Project. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied, where time was the age-at-death, and the factor or covariate was presence or absence of cribra orbitalia. Of 37 samples that produced significant results, 21 demonstrated a change in relationship when the subadults were excluded from analysis. When subadults were included, individuals with cribra orbitalia present had statistically significant lower survival time. With subadults excluded, the relationship either became nonsignificant or was reversed. We demonstrate that in many cases the inclusion of subadults in analysis impacts upon the apparent mortality associated with cribra orbitalia. Examining cribra orbitalia in children and adults has two separate goals: in children, to determine the prevalence and risk of death associated with active lesions and stress; and in adults, to determine whether childhood health assaults that cause cribra orbitalia are associated with frailty or resilience.",10.1002/ajpa.24091,32578874,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 17:39:12.466465-04:00,No,,

For example, over the last 12,000 years the vast majority of human populations shifted from foraging to practicing different forms of agriculture. The shift to farming is widely understood to have impacted several aspects of human demography and biology, including mortality risk, population growth, adult body size, and physical markers of health. However, these trends have not been integrated within an over-arching conceptual framework, and there is poor understanding of why populations tended to increase in population size during periods when markers of health deteriorated. Here, we offer a novel conceptual approach based on evolutionary life history theory. This theory assumes that energy availability is finite and must be allocated in competition between the functions of maintenance, growth, reproduction, and defence. In any given environment, and at any given stage during the life-course, natural selection favours energy allocation strategies that maximise fitness. We argue that the origins of agriculture involved profound transformations in human life history strategies, impacting both the availability of energy and the way that it was allocated between life history functions in the body. Although overall energy supply increased, the diet composition changed, while sedentary populations were challenged by new infectious burdens. We propose that this composite new ecological niche favoured increased energy allocation to defence (immune function) and reproduction, thus reducing the allocation to growth and maintenance. We review evidence in support of this hypothesis and highlight how further work could address both heterogeneity and specific aspects of the origins of agriculture in more detail. Our approach can be applied to many other transformations of the human subsistence niche, and can shed new light on the way that health, height, life expectancy, and fertility patterns are changing in association with globalization and nutrition transition.",10.3389/fendo.2020.00325,32508752,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 12:15:16.233650-04:00,No,,

Many recent comparative analyses of hominin footprints have used 3D analytical methods to assess their morphological affinities, comparing tracks from different locations and/or time periods. However, environmental conditions can sometimes preclude 3D digital capture, as was the case at Happisburgh (England) in 2013. Consequently, we use here a 2D geometric morphometric approach to investigate the evolutionary context of the Happisburgh tracks. The comparative sample of hominin tracks comes from eight localities that span a broad temporal range from the Pliocene to Late Holocene. The results show disparity in the shapes of tracks ascribed to hominins from the Pliocene (presumably Australopithecus afarensis), Pleistocene (presumably Homo erectus and Homo antecessor), and Holocene (Homo sapiens). Three distinct morphological differences are apparent between time samples: changes in adduction of the hallux, changes in the shape and position of the medial longitudinal arch impression, and apparent changes in foot proportions. Linear dimensions classified the potential H.&#xa0;antecessor tracks from Happisburgh as being most similar to the presumed H.&#xa0;erectus prints from Ileret. We demonstrate using 2D geometric morphometric methods and linear dimensions that the Happisburgh tracks are morphologically similar to other presumed Homo tracks and differ from the Laetoli footprints.

It is commonly held that microliths were used as modular inserts in composite projectiles, while their incorporation in other tools for different tasks is generally overlooked, the latter aspect being the main focus of this paper. We present here a more inclusive approach through a case study of the Geometric Kebaran (Middle Epipalaeolithic, ca. 18,500-15,000 cal BP) site of Neve David, Mount Carmel, Israel. Recent excavations at the site exposed a variety of features, and one well-preserved shallow pit provided a large lithic assemblage with ca. 90 microliths. We studied this assemblage using both the low- and high- magnification use-wear protocols, accompanied by a range of experiments. Our results show that a) the fragmentation rate is very high in this assemblage (ca. 90%), b) most of the microliths have identifiable use-wear, c) the microliths were commonly used as inserts in composite projectiles, d) many microliths were used for functions not related to weaponry and hunting, such as wood-working, weed harvesting and meat processing. These findings strongly support the suggestion that the small insets, regardless of their specific type (trapeze, rectangle, backed/retouched bladelet), were used in a wide variety of composite tools. We argue that such a versatile approach and flexibility in the use of microliths reflect a technological advantage where a minimal set of microlithic types, produced in large numbers, could provide the required elements for weapons, as well as for a variety of cutting, processing and harvesting tools needed for mundane tasks at a large Middle Epipalaeolithic camp.",10.1371/journal.pone.0233340,32492038,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:44:33.611270-04:00,No,,

Besides resulting from extensive gene flow, this might be ascribable also to local adaptations to diverse ecological contexts evolved by people who anciently spread along the Italian Peninsula. Dissecting the evolutionary history of the ancestors of present-day Italians may thus improve the understanding of demographic and biological processes that contributed to shape the gene pool of European populations. However, previous SNP array-based studies failed to investigate the full spectrum of Italian variation, generally neglecting low-frequency genetic variants and examining a limited set of small effect size alleles, which may represent important determinants of population structure and complex adaptive traits. To overcome these issues, we analyzed 38 high-coverage whole-genome sequences representative of population clusters at the opposite ends of the cline of Italian variation, along with a large panel of modern and ancient Euro-Mediterranean genomes. We provided evidence for the early divergence of Italian groups dating back to the Late Glacial and for Neolithic and distinct Bronze Age migrations having further differentiated their gene pools. We inferred adaptive evolution at insulin-related loci in people from Italian regions with a temperate climate, while possible adaptations to pathogens and ultraviolet radiation were observed in Mediterranean Italians. Some of these adaptive events may also have secondarily modulated population disease or longevity predisposition. We disentangled the contribution of multiple migratory and adaptive events in shaping the heterogeneous Italian genomic background, which exemplify population dynamics and gene-environment interactions that played significant roles also in the formation of the Continental and Southern European genomic landscapes.",10.1186/s12915-020-00778-4,32438927,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:40:53.316501-04:00,No,,

Notably, the matrilineal genetic diversity of the Hanging Coffin people from southern China is much higher than those from northern Thailand, consistent with the hypothesized single origin of the Hanging Coffin custom in southern China about 3,600 years ago, followed by its dispersal in southern China through demic diffusion, whereas the major dispersal pattern in Southeast Asia is cultural assimilation in the past 2,000 years.",10.1016/j.isci.2020.101032,32304863,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 12:55:05.738410-04:00,No,,

At this point, a complex history of migration is thought to have begun with the arrival of people sharing ancestry with Near Oceanic groups (i.e., Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking groups), and was then followed by the arrival of non-Oceanic groups during European colonialism. However, the specifics of this peopling are not entirely clear from the archaeological and anthropological records, and is therefore a focus of continued debate. To shed additional light on the Samoan population history that this peopling reflects, we employ a population genetic approach to analyze 1,197 Samoan high-coverage whole genomes. We identify population splits between the major Samoan islands and detect asymmetrical gene flow to the capital city. We also find an extreme bottleneck until about 1,000 y ago, which is followed by distinct expansions across the islands and subsequent bottlenecks consistent with European colonization.

Archaeology is the study of interactions of natural and social environments through time and across space. As well, the field of cultural resources management, which includes archaeology, regularly engages with values such as site significance and allocation of funding that the modern social environment ascribes to its own history. Through these two approaches, archaeology has potential to provide both data for and methods of addressing challenges the global community faces through climate change. To date, however, archaeology and related areas of cultural heritage have had relatively little role in the global climate response. Here, we assess the social environment of archaeology and climate change and resulting structural barriers that have limited use of archaeology in and for climate change with a case study of the US federal government.

In the face of this loss, previously excavated collections from these sites-referred to as legacy collections-offer a source of climate and other paleoenvironmental information that may no longer exist elsewhere.

Increased toolmaking skills and technological innovations are evident in the Nihewan Basin at the onset of the Mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition (MPT). Examination of the lithic technology of the Nihewan sites, together with an assessment of other key Palaeolithic sites of China, indicates that toolkits show increasing diversity at the outset of the MPT and in its aftermath. The overall evidence indicates the adaptive flexibility of early hominins to ecosystem changes since the MPT, though regional abandonments are also apparent in high latitudes, likely owing to cold and oscillating environmental conditions.

Inherent to these lifeways were several triggers of social stress including population nucleation and increase, intergroup conflict (warfare), and increased territoriality. Here, we examine whether this period of social stress co-varied with deadlier weaponry, specifically, the design of the most commonly found prehistoric archery component in late pre-contact North America: triangular stone arrow tips (TSAT). The examination of modern metal or carbon projectiles, arrows, and arrowheads has demonstrated that smaller arrow tips penetrate deeper into a target than do larger ones. We first experimentally confirm that this relationship applies to arrow tips made from stone hafted onto shafts made from wood. We then statistically assess a large sample (n = 742) of late pre-contact TSAT and show that these specimens are extraordinarily small. Thus, by miniaturizing their arrow tips, prehistoric people in Eastern North America optimized their projectile weaponry for maximum penetration and killing power in warfare and hunting. Finally, we verify that these functional advantages were selected across environmental and cultural boundaries. Thus, while we cannot and should not rule out stochastic, production economizing, or non-adaptive cultural processes as an explanation for TSAT, overall our results are consistent with the hypothesis that broad, socially stressful demographic changes in late pre-contact Eastern North America resulted in the miniaturization-and augmented lethality-of stone tools across the region.",10.1371/journal.pone.0230348,32182279,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:10:56.817555-04:00,No,,

Debates have focused on the redistribution of foods brought to camp, though the proper interpretation of results is contested. Here we instead address this question using two nutritional variables, employed as proxies for longer-term food access. We also report on broader patterns in nutritional status. We measured male hunting success, hemoglobin concentration and body fatness among bush-living Hadza. Hunting success was measured using an aggregated reputation score. Hemoglobin concentration, a proxy for dietary red meat, was measured from fingerprick capillary blood. Body fatness, a proxy for energy balance, was measured using BMI and bioelectrical impedance. We find no statistically significant relationship between a hunter's success and any measure of his nutritional status or that of his spouse. We further find that: women are, as elsewhere, at greater risk of iron-deficiency anemia than men; men had slightly lower BMIs than women; men but not women had significantly lower hemoglobin levels than in the 1960s. The absence of an association between hunting reputation and nutritional status is consistent with generalized food sharing.

The recent, as yet unpublished, technological studies highlight a clear technological break between these two entities. In Hayonim, the Acheulo-Yabrudian assemblages found at the bottom of the archeological sequence display the specific combination of bifacial shaping and the production of thick, often cortical, flakes frequently shaped into scrapers by Quina retouch. Neither of these lithic production systems is observed in the succeeding Levantine Middle Paleolithic assemblages. In contrast, the Early Middle Paleolithic is characterized by the expansion and diversification of the Levallois production system in its full-fledged form, the emergence of a specific Laminar technology, and a high proportion of retouched tools made on elongated blanks (points and blades). These technological features are unknown in the previous Acheulo-Yabrudian assemblages in the cave. Based on this information, we attempt to determine if the observed changes in stone tool production strategies resulted from an autochthonous development or a dispersal out of Africa.",10.1016/j.jhevol.2019.102733,32062431,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 18:06:26.490330-04:00,No,,

Insects are among the most affected groups, with documented decreases in abundance up to 76% in the last 25-30 years in some terrestrial ecosystems. Identifying the underlying drivers is a major obstacle as most ecosystems are affected by multiple stressors simultaneously and in situ measurements of environmental variables are often missing. In our study, we investigated a headwater stream belonging to the most common stream type in Germany located in a nature reserve with no major anthropogenic impacts except climate change. We used the most comprehensive quantitative long-term data set on aquatic insects available, which includes weekly measurements of species-level insect abundance, daily water temperature and stream discharge as well as measurements of additional physicochemical variables for a 42-year period (1969-2010). Overall, water temperature increased by 1.88&#xa0;&#xb0;C and discharge patterns changed significantly. These changes were accompanied by an 81.6% decline in insect abundance, but an increase in richness (+8.5%), Shannon diversity (+22.7%), evenness (+22.4%), and interannual turnover (+34%). Moreover, the community's trophic structure and phenology changed: the duration of emergence increased by 15.2 days, whereas the peak of emergence moved 13.4 days earlier. Additionally, we observed short-term fluctuations (&lt;5 years) in almost all metrics as well as complex and nonlinear responses of the community toward climate change that would have been missed by simply using snapshot data or shorter time series. Our results indicate that climate change has already altered biotic communities severely even in protected areas, where no other interacting stressors (pollution, habitat fragmentation, etc.) are present. This is a striking example of the scientific value of comprehensive long-term data in capturing the complex responses of communities toward climate change. Cambios Complejos y No Lineales Causados por el Clima en Comunidades de Insectos de Agua Dulce durante 42 A&#xf1;os Resumen La continua crisis de la biodiversidad se vuelve evidente en la ampliamente documentada declinaci&#xf3;n en la abundancia y diversidad de especies, cambios profundos en la estructura de las comunidades y modificaciones en la fenolog&#xed;a de las especies. Los insectos se encuentran entre los grupos m&#xe1;s afectados; se han documentado reducciones en la abundancia de hasta el 76% en los &#xfa;ltimos 25-30 a&#xf1;os en algunos ecosistemas terrestres. La identificaci&#xf3;n de los causantes subyacentes es un gran obst&#xe1;culo porque la mayor&#xed;a de los ecosistemas est&#xe1;n afectados por varios factores estresantes simult&#xe1;neamente y con frecuencia faltan las medidas in situ de las variables ambientales. Investigamos un flujo naciente perteneciente al tipo de arroyo m&#xe1;s com&#xfa;n en Alemania ubicado dentro de una reserva natural sin impactos antropog&#xe9;nicos importantes a excepci&#xf3;n del cambio clim&#xe1;tico. Usamos el conjunto m&#xe1;s completo disponible de datos cuantitativos de largo plazo para insectos acu&#xe1;ticos que incluye las medidas semanales de abundancia de insectos a nivel especie, las medidas diarias de la temperatura del agua y la descarga del flujo y las medidas de variables f&#xed;sico-qu&#xed;micas adicionales durante 42 a&#xf1;os (1969 - 2010). En general, la temperatura del agua increment&#xf3; 1.88&#xb0;C y los patrones de descarga cambiaron significativamente. Estos cambios estuvieron acompa&#xf1;ados por una declinaci&#xf3;n del 81.6% en la abundancia de insectos, pero tambi&#xe9;n de un incremento en la riqueza (+8.5%), la diversidad Shannon (+22.7%), la uniformidad (+22.4%) y la renovaci&#xf3;n interanual (+34%). Adem&#xe1;s, la estructura tr&#xf3;fica y la fenolog&#xed;a de la comunidad cambiaron: la duraci&#xf3;n del surgimiento increment&#xf3; en 15.2 d&#xed;as y el pico del surgimiento ocurri&#xf3; con 13.4 d&#xed;as de anticipaci&#xf3;n. Observamos fluctuaciones a corto plazo (&lt;5 a&#xf1;os) en casi todas las medidas, as&#xed; como respuestas complejas y no lineales de la comunidad hacia el cambio clim&#xe1;tico que podr&#xed;an haber sido ignoradas si s&#xf3;lo se usaran datos instant&#xe1;neos o series de tiempo m&#xe1;s cortas.

The results show significant differences in infant- and child-rearing practices, in subsistence strategies, and in landscape use between burial locations. From this, we posit that the presence of communities with distinct lifestyles and cultural backgrounds is a primary reason for Late Neolithic variability in burial location in Western Europe and provides evidence of an early """"them and us"""" scenario.

This archaic stone tool assemblage comprises two, very different groups of tools, made from distinct raw materials. On the one hand, a small-sized toolkit knapped from Jurassic flint, comprising intensively exploited cores and small-sized flakes and fragments and, on the other hand, a large-sized limestone toolkit that is mainly linked to percussive activities. In recent years, the limestone macro-tools have been the center of particular attention, leading to a re-evaluation of their role in the assemblage. Main results bring to light strict hominin selective processes, mainly concerning the quality of the limestone and the morphology of the cobbles, in relation to their use-patterning. In addition to the variety of traces of percussion identified on the limestone tools, recurrences have recently been documented in their positioning and in the morphology of the active surfaces. Coupled with experimental work, this data has contributed to formulating hypothesis about the range of uses for these tools, beyond stone knapping and butchery, for activities such as: wood-working or tendon and meat tenderizing. The abundance of hammerstones, as well as the presence of heavy-duty scrapers, are special features recognized for the limestone component of the Barranco Le&#xf3;n assemblage. This paper presents, for the first time, another characteristic of the assemblage: the presence of polyhedral and, especially, subspheroid morphologies, virtually unknown in the European context for this timeframe. We present an analysis of these tools, combining qualitative evaluation of the raw materials, diacritical study, 3D geometric morphometric analysis of facet angles and an evaluation of the type and position of percussive traces; opening up the discussion of the late Oldowan beyond the African context.",10.1371/journal.pone.0228290,31999766,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:42:36.194434-04:00,No,,

Here we focused on the chronology of landsliding in this area using geological, archaeological and historical evidence. The earliest records of landsliding were determined in locations underlying the dated archaeological settlements. The Upper Paleolithic settlement complex dated between 37-24 ka cal BP, was originally deposited over these landslides. It was consequently destroyed in certain places by additional landslides preceding the last (Upper Pleniglacial) loess deposition (22 ka cal BP). These landslides took place before and after the Upper Paleolithic occupation of this area. This Pleistocene landslide event ranks among the oldest (albeit indirectly) dated landslide within the Czech part of the Western Carpathian Flysch Belt. The chronology of later, historical, landsliding was determined using written records (chronicles, official reports, archival evidence, etc.). Continuous records of landsliding were available as of the middle of the seventeenth century. The major concentration of landslides occurred at the beginning of the twentieth century (1910-1915).

The aim of the research was to develop robust provenance hypotheses for 4th and 3rd millennia BC metals from an important, yet hitherto neglected, metallurgical district in prehistoric Europe, displaying precocious copper mining and smelting, as well as socially significant uses of metals in 'Rinaldone-style' burials. All major (and most minor) ore bodies from Tuscany and neighbouring regions were characterised chemically and isotopically, and 20 Copper Age axe-heads, daggers and halberds were sampled and analysed. The objects were also reassessed archaeologically, paying special attention to find context, typology, and chronology. This multi-pronged approach has allowed us to challenge received wisdom concerning the local character of early metal production and exchange in the region. The research has shown that most objects were likely manufactured in west-central Italy using copper from Southern Tuscany and, quite possibly, the Apuanian Alps. A few objects, however, display isotopic and chemical signatures compatible with the Western Alpine and, in one case, French ore deposits. This shows that the Copper Age communities of west-central Italy participated in superregional exchange networks tying together the middle/upper Tyrrhenian region, the western Alps, and perhaps the French Midi. These networks were largely independent from other metal displacement circuits in operation at the time, which embraced the north-Alpine region and the south-eastern Alps, respectively.",10.1371/journal.pone.0227259,31968000,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 18:08:21.765288-04:00,No,,

13096,Assessing the occurrence and status of wheat in late Neolithic central China: the importance of direct AMS radiocarbon dates from Xiazhai.,,,,,Agriculture; Bronze Age; Silk road; Triticum aestivum; Urbanisation,Vegetation history and archaeobotany,Veg Hist Archaeobot,24,09,2021,"The introduction of wheat into central China is thought to have been one of the significant contributions of interactions between China and Central Asia which began in the 3rd millennium bc. However, only a limited number of Neolithic wheat grains have been found in central China and even fewer have been directly radiocarbon dated, making the date when wheat was adopted in the region and its role in subsistence farming uncertain. Based on systematic archaeobotanical data and direct dating of wheat remains from the Xiazhai site in central China, as well as a critical review of all reported discoveries of Neolithic and Bronze Age wheat from this region, we conclude that many wheat finds are intrusive in Neolithic contexts. We argue that the role of wheat in the subsistence of the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age of central China was minimal, and that wheat only began to increase in its subsistence role in the later Bronze Age during the Zhou dynasty after ca. 1000 bc.",10.1007/s00334-019-00732-7,31956277,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:38:07.086418-04:00,No,,

Competing hypotheses have identified five separate migrations from the mainland with a separate debate concerning the colonization of The Bahamas. Significant differences in the facial morphology of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of Hispaniola and Cuba led to the present study of Lucayan skulls from The Bahamas. The goal was to determine which group the native Lucayans more closely resembled to resolve this long-standing dispute. The results indicate that they are related to groups from Hispaniola and Jamaica and not to Cuban inhabitants.

Taphonomy showed that this was an emergency burial site associated with a catastrophic event, possibly an epidemic of unknown etiology with high mortality rates. In this perspective, paleoparasitological investigations were performed on 18 individuals exhumed from 9 multiple graves to assess the burden of gastrointestinal parasitism.

It is more than plausible that the epidemic, possibly coupled with the disruption of the aqueduct, deeply affected the living conditions of these individuals.

We investigated the diversity of HvCKX2.1 in 228 barley landraces and 216 wild accessions and identified 14 haplotypes, five of these with ten or more members, coding for four different protein variants. The third largest haplotype was abundant in wild accessions (51 members), but absent from the landrace collection. Protein structure predictions indicated that the amino acid substitution specific to haplotype 3 could result in a change in the functional properties of the HvCKX2.1 protein. Haplotypes 1-3 have overlapping geographical distributions in the wild population, but the average rainfall amounts at the collection sites for haplotype 3 plants are significantly higher during November to February compared to the equivalent data for plants of haplotypes 1 and 2. We argue that the likelihood that haplotype 3 plants were excluded from landraces by sampling bias that occurred when the first wild barley plants were taken into cultivation is low, and that it is reasonable to suggest that plants with haplotype 3 are absent from the crop because these plants were less suited to the artificial conditions associated with cultivation. Although the cytokinin signalling pathway influences many aspects of plant development, the identified role of HvCKX2.1 in the drought response raises the possibility that the particular aspect of cultivation that mitigated against haplotype 3 relates in some way to water utilization.

The Marillac sinkhole was occasionally used by humans to process the carcasses of different prey, but there is no evidence for a residential use of the site, nor have any hearths been found. Rare carnivore bones were also discovered, demonstrating that the sinkhole was seasonally used, not only by Neanderthals, but also by predators across several millennia.

As such, they provide a triple-bonus (reduced risk from ambush, ease of terrestrial travel and higher foraging returns) for some primates. However, previous studies have not yet accounted for other types of predators e.g., coursing (endurance predators that can pursue prey over long distances) which were sympatric with hominins and may also have exploited these environments. Behavioral ecology studies on the use of burned landscapes by extant carnivores demonstrate that while some ambush predators avoid recently burned areas, coursing predators do take advantage of their immediate hunting opportunities. Research examining habitat selection by animals under the simultaneous threat of multiple predator species with different modes of hunting, and the diversity of Plio-Pleistocene carnivore guild is suggestive of two possible evolutionary scenarios in which hominins could either have selected or avoided burned areas (3-2 mya), based on whether ambush or coursing predators were perceived as presenting the greatest risk.",10.1002/evan.21807,31652026,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:48:52.534063-04:00,No,,

There are several new possibilities that they offer; for instance, the easier and faster sharing of data among institutions, the possibility of permanent documentation, or new opportunities of data analysis. An important requirement, however, is whether the data obtained from different scanning devices are comparable and whether the possible varying outputs could affect further analyses, such as the estimation of the biological profile. Therefore, we aimed to investigate two important questions: (1) whether 3D models acquired by two different scanning technologies (structured light and laser) are comparable and (2) whether the scanning equipment has an effect on the anthropological analyses, such as age-at-death estimation and sex assessment. 3D models of ossa coxa (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;29) were acquired by laser (NextEngine) and structured light (HP 3D Structured Light Scanner PRO 2) scanners.

Often situated in coastal beach ridges or sand dunes, these sites exhibit horizontal and vertical disturbances, datable materials such as wood charcoal are typically highly degraded, may be derived from old trees or driftwood unless specifically identified to short-lived material, while bone collagen rarely survives in tropical conditions. Shell, therefore, is the most logical material for dating Pacific sites since it is resistant to alteration, can be sampled to ensure only the last few seasons of growth are represented and is often closely tied to human economic activities. However, shell radiocarbon (14C) dating has been plagued by interpretive problems largely due to our limited knowledge of the 14C cycle in nearshore marine and estuarine environments. Consequently, shell dates are typically ignored in regional chronometric evaluations and in recent years shell is often avoided for dating altogether. Recent advances in our understanding of the source of shell 14C as well as the development of the first South Pacific Gyre model of changing marine 14C over time, combined with Bayesian statistical modelling, now provide us with insight into the value of these shell radiocarbon dates. Here we present a revision of the age of the To'aga site on Ofu Island-an early occupation site associated with the initial Polynesian Plainware period in S&#x101;moa, the earliest use of which we date to between 2785 and 2607 cal BP (68% probability).",10.1371/journal.pone.0211990,31487294,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 01:08:25.988395-04:00,No,,

The deposits contain successive occupation layers with abundant faunal remains, stone artifacts, and sometimes hominin remains attributed to Homo erectus tautavelensis. The Unit D levels are chronostratigraphically positioned at the top of the ES III sequence, accumulated at the end of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 12.

Rather, its features indicate a trend towards microproduction that continues into subsequent occupational phases, apparently marking a local expression of the transition from the Lower to the Middle Paleolithic. Remarkably, tiny discoid and multidirectional type cores, predominantly knapped from small-sized quartz pebbles, characterize the Unit D lithic assemblage. Experimental work presented here demonstrates the likelihood that, despite the small size of the cores and the recalcitrant crystalline materials from which they were knapped, flake production can be carried out with free-hand hard hammer techniques.

The results indicate that archaeological human activity associated with ironwork and pottery production had severe negative effects on many genera of small and medium-sized mammals.

Here, this hypothesis was tested. Seventeen traits (six 'functional', six 'mechanistic' and five 'intermediate') were measured from 19 populations of oleaster (wild olive) along a climatic gradient in Morocco. Principal components analysis of the trait dataset identified size and the 'worldwide leaf economics spectrum' as PCA axes 1 and 2.

Specifically, cultural differences between two Early Upper Paleolithic entities, the Early Ahmarian and the Levantine Aurignacian, raise the question of differing adaptations. In this article we use archaeofaunal remains from the Early Upper Paleolithic sequence at Manot Cave (Western Galilee, Israel), to track human hunting patterns, carcass transport and processing within the Early Ahmarian (46-42 ka) and Levantine Aurignacian (38-34 ka) phases. We test two hypotheses: 1) the Ahmarian and Aurignacian represent adaptations to different environments; and 2) the two entities differ in mobility patterns and site use. Our multivariate taphonomic analysis showed subtle differences in depositional processes between the two phases and demonstrated a primarily anthropogenic complex. In both phases, human subsistence was based on two ungulate species, mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) and Mesopotamian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica), with some contribution from birds, tortoises and small mammals. Among the gazelles, it appears that female herds were targeted, and that hunting took place close to the cave. The results of the research show great similarity in environmental exploitation between the Ahmarian and Aurignacian phases concerning prey spectrum and choice, carcass transport and processing. These patterns occupy a middle position between the Middle Paleolithic and the late Epipaleolithic of the region. Despite this, there are also several significant differences between the phases such as increased exploitation of small game (especially birds) and faster accumulation and higher densities of material in the Aurignacian. This may indicate greater occupation intensity during the Aurignacian compared to the Ahmarian, and thus could explain the outstanding character of this entity in the Levant.",10.1016/j.jhevol.2019.05.007,31227173,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:47:25.661509-04:00,No,,

Two issues hamper our understanding of this process: the limited hominin fossil record, and incomplete knowledge about hominin spatial occupation of Africa. Here, we analyze the presently known hominin fossil distribution pattern and explore the potential geographic distribution of hominins between &#x223c;4.5 and &#x223c;2.5&#xa0;Ma. We focus on assessing the relevance of the Coastal Forest of Eastern Africa (CFEA) along the Indian Ocean as a core area for early hominin evolution. Based on biogeographic-phylogeographic data we propose the coastal refuge hypothesis: the CFEA provided a refugium for early hominins in periods of variable climate and strong seasonality during eccentricity maxima. From this refuge, evolved species could disperse inland (e.g. to rift basins) via vegetated humid corridors, whenever onset of stable climate periods with low seasonality during eccentricity minima allowed expansion out of the coastal enclave. We develop a conceptual model in time and space, comparing predictions with climatic and hominin fossil records. The results imply that: 1) between &#x223c;4.5 and 3&#xa0;Ma, ongoing (mostly anagenetic) hominin evolution occurred in the CFEA, punctuated by inland dispersal events at &#x223c;4.4, 4.2, 3.8, 3.5, and 3.2&#xa0;Ma; 2) before &#x223c;3&#xa0;Ma, the Afar Basin was a (sub)core area often connected to and relatively similar to the CFEA, while other inland areas were more or less marginal for early hominin habitation; 3) after &#x223c;3&#xa0;Ma, Northern Hemisphere Glaciation exerted strong influence by causing latitudinal contraction of the CFEA, leading to habitat fragmentation, isolation of hominin populations and possible cladogenetic evolution. A major challenge for the coastal refuge model is the fact that at present, no (hominin) fossils are known from the CFEA. We consider how this can be explained, and possibly overcome with targeted search efforts. Furthermore we discuss how the model can be tested, e.g. with molecular phylogeography approaches, and used to predict new hominin fossil locations. With this study, we hope to contribute a fresh perspective to the climate-evolution debate, emphasizing the role of climatic stability, length of dry season and vegetation cover to facilitate connectivity between hominin core and marginal habitats.",10.1016/j.jhevol.2019.03.012,31182201,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:42:33.335887-04:00,No,,

While the environmental conditions across the northwestern slopes of the IAMC provided adequate resources for incipient farming and herding as early as the mid-3rd mill. BCE, the development of local agricultural strategies on the extremely arid and eroded foothills on the southeastern, leeward side of the mountains remain comparatively less studied. Our study tackles this problem by combining geoarchaeological analysis with conventional macrobotanical identification in the investigation of a 1st-mill. CE agro-pastoralist farming site, Mohuchahangoukou (MGK), located on the arid foothills of the Tianshan range. Our results illustrate how ancient agro-pastoralists at MGK innovated irrigation systems both to combat water shortage and, importantly, to trap sediments carried by flood-water for crop cultivation. By synthesizing currently available data, we estimate that they managed to trap about 40 cm of fine-grained sediment within a span of 200 years or even less. These stone-built field systems helped water a diverse stand of crops and create deeper soils in an otherwise deflated landscape with thin desert soils. Since we detected high levels of salt concentration (&gt;2 dSm-1) in the lower portions of all three test trenches we analyzed, we conclude that soil salinization might have affected the long-term sustainability of this form of irrigated field management. We also infer that, besides engineering efforts, the ancient agro-pastoralists at MGK had to resolve the scheduling conflicts between irrigated farming and animal herding through labor specialization.""",10.1371/journal.pone.0217171,31167227,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 01:42:30.657385-04:00,No,,

To date, only zooarchaeological evidence has been discussed in regard to the subsistence of its builders. G&#xf6;bekli Tepe consists of monumental round to oval buildings, erected in an earlier phase, and smaller rectangular buildings, built around them in a partially contemporaneous and later phase. The monumental buildings are best known as they were in the focus of research. They are around 20 m in diameter and have stone pillars that are up to 5.5 m high and often richly decorated. The rectangular buildings are smaller and-in some cases-have up to 2 m high, mostly undecorated, pillars. Especially striking is the number of tools related to food processing, including grinding slabs/bowls, handstones, pestles, and mortars, which have not been studied before. We analyzed more than 7000 artifacts for the present contribution. The high frequency of artifacts is unusual for contemporary sites in the region. Using an integrated approach of formal, experimental, and macro- / microscopical use-wear analyses we show that Neolithic people at G&#xf6;bekli Tepe have produced standardized and efficient grinding tools, most of which have been used for the processing of cereals. Additional phytolith analysis confirms the massive presence of cereals at the site, filling the gap left by the weakly preserved charred macro-rests. The organization of work and food supply has always been a central question of research into G&#xf6;bekli Tepe, as the construction and maintenance of the monumental architecture would have necessitated a considerable work force. Contextual analyses of the distribution of the elements of the grinding kit on site highlight a clear link between plant food preparation and the rectangular buildings and indicate clear delimitations of working areas for food production on the terraces the structures lie on, surrounding the circular buildings. There is evidence for extensive plant food processing and archaeozoological data hint at large-scale hunting of gazelle between midsummer and autumn.

Dynamic selection pressures acted sequentially to shape architectural and nutritional domestication traits and to facilitate adaptation to the local environment. Later introgression between sorghum races allowed the exchange of adaptive traits and achieved mutual genomic rescue through an ameliorated mutation load. These results reveal a model of domestication in which genomic adaptation and deterioration were not focused on the initial stages of domestication but occurred throughout the history of cultivation.",10.1038/s41477-019-0397-9,30962527,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:35:56.123184-04:00,No,,

This species seems to have been an important part of human subsistence strategies in the region from at least the Early Holocene, and its current distribution may be a legacy of past human settlement. Because B. excelsa is a long-lived pioneer tree it requires natural or human disturbances to increase light availability in the understory for a successful establishment. However, it remains unclear how the long-term population dynamics of this species have been shaped by pre-colonial and post-colonial human practices. Here, we use tree-ring analyses to look at changes in growing conditions over the past 400 years in a Brazil nut tree population in Central Amazonia. We identify changes in tree recruitment and growth rates associated not only with regional climatic variability, but also major political and socio-economic activities recorded by historical documents in the vicinity of Manaus. We demonstrate that the expansion of a post-colonial political center (Manaus) from the middle of the 18th century onwards coincided with a reduction in recruitment of B. excelsa. We argue that this hiatus suggests the interruption of indigenous management practices, probably due to the collapse of pre-Columbian societies. A second recruitment pulse, and unprecedented cycles of growth release and suppression, aligns with a shift to modern exploitation of the forest into the 20th century. Our findings shed light on how past histories of human-forest interactions can be revealed by the growth rings of trees in Amazonia. Future interdisciplinary analysis of these trees should enable more detailed investigation of how human forest management has changed in this part of the world, through pre-colonial, colonial, and industrial periods of human activity, with potential implications for conservation.",10.1371/journal.pone.0214128,30943230,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 15:11:25.948502-04:00,No,,

High-resolution dialysis and diffusive gradients in thin film (DGT) sampling techniques were used. Results indicated that in July 2016 and January 2017, the concentrations of soluble Cr and DGT-labile Cr(VI) in the overlying water exceeded both drinking and fishery water quality standards, resulting from the high mobility of Cr in sediments. In July (summer), the high concentration of soluble Cr (134.04 &#xb1; 7.20 &#x3bc;g/L) detected in the anaerobic sediments was primarily caused by the complexation of Cr(III) with dissolved organic matter (DOM). This mechanism was supported by an observed simultaneous increase of soluble Cr and DOM under simulated anaerobic conditions. In January (winter), the high concentrations of soluble Cr (97.55 &#xb1; 9.65 &#x3bc;g/L) and DGT-labile Cr(VI) (25.83 &#xb1; 1.25 &#x3bc;g/L) in aerobic sediments were primarily caused by reoxidation of Cr(III) by Mn(III/IV) oxides as evidenced by the lowest concentrations of soluble and DGT-labile Mn(II).

The site has served as a cemetery for thousands of years and is where most of the Early Dynastic royal tombs are located. North Abydos includes the Middle Cemetery and the North Cemetery, which are separated from each other by a wadi. The Middle Cemetery was the burial ground for important Sixth Dynasty (2407-2260 BC) officials and over time for thousands of elite and non-elite individuals as well. Excavations at the core area of the Old Kingdom mortuary landscape have revealed many culturally important wooden objects but these are often found with extensive deterioration that can compromise their preservation. The objectives of this study were to characterize the biodegradation that has taken place in excavated wooden objects, elucidate the type of wood degradation present, obtain information on soil properties at the site and identify fungi currently associated with the wood and soils. Light and scanning electron microscopy studies were used to observe the micromorphological characteristics of the wood, and culturing on different media was done to isolate fungi. Identification of the fungi was done by examining morphological characteristics and extracting rDNA from pure cultures and sequencing the ITS region. Wooden objects, made from Cedrus, Juniperus and Acacia as well as several unidentified hardwoods, were found with extensive degradation and were exceedingly fragile. Termite damage was evident and frass from the subterranean termites along with sand particles were present in most woods. Evidence of soft rot attack was found in sections of wood that remained. Fungi isolated from wood and soils were identified as species of Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium, Stemphylium Talaromyces and Trichoderma.

Lately, numerous aDNA studies have turned the tide in favour of migrations, leaving only a few cases in Neolithic Europe where hunter-gatherers might have adopted agriculture. It is thus widely accepted that agriculture was expanding to its northern extreme in Sweden c. 4000 BC by migrating Funnel Beaker Culture (FBC) farmers. This was followed by intense contacts with local hunter-gatherers, leading to the development of the Pitted Ware Culture (PWC), who nonetheless relied on maritime prey. Here, we present archaeobotanical remains from Sweden and the &#xc5;land archipelago (Finland) showing that PWC used free-threshing barley and hulled and free-threshing wheat from c. 3300 BC. We suggest that these hunter-gatherers adopted cultivation from FBC farmers and brought it to islands beyond the 60th parallel north. Based on directly dated grains, land areas suitable for cultivation, and absence of signs of exchange with FBC in Sweden, we argue that PWC cultivated crops in &#xc5;land.

Given the potential for currently stabilised dune systems to reactivate under climate change and increased anthropogenic pressures, identifying the role of external disturbances in driving geomorphic response is vitally important. We developed a novel approach, using artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to time series of historical reactivation-deposition events from the Nebraska Sandhills, to determine the relationship between historic periods of sand deposition in semi-arid grasslands and external climatic conditions, land use pressures and wildfire occurrence. We show that both vegetation growth and sediment re-deposition episodes can be accurately estimated. Sensitivity testing of individual factors shows that localised forcings (overgrazing and wildfire) have a statistically significant impact when the climate is held at present-day conditions. However, the dominant effect is climate-induced drought.

The Early Neolithic material studied includes human remains found in two separate assemblages. Assemblage A consists of one skull-cup, a non-manipulated adult human mandible, and four ceramic vessels. Assemblage B contains manipulated and non-manipulated human remains that appeared mingled with domestic waste. Using a taphonomic approach, we evaluate the skull-cup processing and the anthropogenic alteration of human bones. The skull-cup was processed by careful paring away of skin, fragmentation of the facial skeleton and base of the skull, and controlled percussion of the edges of the calotte to achieve a regular shape. It was later boiled for some time in a container that caused pot polish in a specific area. The other human bones appeared scattered throughout the living area, mixed with other remains of domestic activity. Some of these bones show cut marks, percussion damage for marrow extraction, and tooth/chewing marks. Evidence from Cueva de El Toro suggests that cannibalism was conducted in the domestic sphere, likely following ritualized practices where the skull-cup could have played a part. Interpretation of this evidence suggests two hypotheses: (a) aggressive cannibalism relates to extreme inter-group violence; and (b) funerary cannibalism is a facet of multi-stage burial practices. Similar evidence has been found in other Neolithic sites of this region and suggests that cannibalism and skull-cups were elements widespread in these communities.

This methodology can serve as a model to be applied to other assemblages for greater understanding of the origins and spread of the broadly distributed eastern Asian Late Pleistocene microblade industries. Within the eight cultural layers at Shizitan 29, microblade production abruptly appears at the top of Layer 7 following earlier core-and-flake production, supporting hypotheses of microblade technology arising within adaptive strategies to worsening Late Glacial Maximum environments. Significantly, reconstruction of the operational sequence supports microblade technology being introduced into the North China Loess Plateau from regions further north.

However, it is well known that in the case of cremations sex assessment might be complicated by the destructive/transformative effect of the fire on bones. Osteometric standards built on unburned human remains and contemporary cremated series are often inadequate for the analysis of ancient cremations, and frequently result in a significant number of misclassifications. This work is an attempt to overcome the scarcity of methods that could be applied to pre-proto-historic Italy and serve as methodological comparison for other European contexts. A set of 24 anatomical traits were measured on 124 Bronze Age and Iron Age cremated individuals with clearly engendered grave goods. Assuming gender largely correlated to sex, male and female distributions of each individual trait measured were compared to evaluate sexual dimorphism through inferential statistics and Chaktaborty and Majumder's index. The discriminatory power of each variable was evaluated by cross-validation tests. Eight variables yielded an accuracy equal to or greater than 80%. Four of these variables also show a similar degree of precision for both sexes. The most diagnostic measurements are from radius, patella, mandible, talus, femur, first metatarsal, lunate and humerus. Overall, the degree of sexual dimorphism and the reliability of estimates obtained from our series are similar to those of a modern cremated sample recorded by Gon&#xe7;alves and collaborators. Nevertheless, mean values of the male and female distributions in our case study are lower, and the application of the cut-off point calculated from the modern sample to our ancient individuals produces a considerable number of misclassifications.

To better understand the ecological context of the Okote hominins, it is necessary to broaden the geographical focus of the analysis to include the entire Omo-Turkana ecosystem, and the temporal focus to encompass the early Pleistocene. Previous work has shown that important changes in the regional vegetation occurred after 2&#xa0;Ma, and that there was a peak in mammalian turnover and diversity close to 1.8&#xa0;Ma. This peak in diversity included the Hominini, with the species P.&#xa0;boisei, Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, and Homo erectus co-occurring at around 1.8&#xa0;Ma. There is considerable debate about whether H.&#xa0;habilis and H.&#xa0;rudolfensis indeed constitute separate species, but even if we consider them both as H.&#xa0;habilis sensu lato, the co-occurrence of three hominin species at any one time and place is rather unusually high diversity for hominin standards (even if not so for other mammalian groups such as suids, bovids, or cercopithecids). Here we use mammalian faunal abundance data to place confidence intervals on first and last appearances of hominin species in the early Pleistocene of the Omo-Turkana Basin, and use these estimates to discuss hominin diversity in the Okote Member. We suggest that in the early Pleistocene a wide range of depositional environments and vegetation types, along with a high frequency of volcanism, likely maintained high levels of environmental variability both in time and space across the Omo-Turkana region, and provided ecological opportunities for the coexistence of at least three hominin species alongside a diverse mammalian fauna.",10.1016/j.jhevol.2018.10.012,30583846,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:44:08.158096-04:00,No,,

The long-standing presumption in Western thought has been that vision and audition are more objective than the other senses, serving as the basis of knowledge and understanding, whereas touch, taste, and smell are crude and of little value. This predicts that humans ought to be better at communicating about sight and hearing than the other senses, and decades of work based on English and related languages certainly suggests this is true. However, how well does this reflect the diversity of languages and communities worldwide? To test whether there is a universal hierarchy of the senses, stimuli from the five basic senses were used to elicit descriptions in 20 diverse languages, including 3 unrelated sign languages. We found that languages differ fundamentally in which sensory domains they linguistically code systematically, and how they do so. The tendency for better coding in some domains can be explained in part by cultural preoccupations. Although languages seem free to elaborate specific sensory domains, some general tendencies emerge: for example, with some exceptions, smell is poorly coded. The surprise is that, despite the gradual phylogenetic accumulation of the senses, and the imbalances in the neural tissue dedicated to them, no single hierarchy of the senses imposes itself upon language.",10.1073/pnas.1720419115,30397135,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:51:16.806498-04:00,No,,

This potential source of information may help further understanding of past human behaviour in relation to fuel selection, applied type of fire and function of fires lit in hearths. This study examined ash from reference samples and ash and char samples recovered from an Iron Age peatland site in Vlaardingen, the Netherlands. Local availability and abundance made it possible for the occupants of the site to choose from different fuel resources. Peat and cattle dung were readily available, while wood was less abundant. Reference samples from various locations were collected to investigate the properties of ash. Different types of wood, peat and cattle dung were accordingly ashed and analysed. In total, two techniques were used, that is, chemical analyses (x-ray fluorescence (XRF)) for the determination of the elemental composition and microscopic studies on field images of these ashes, mounted on glass slides, to investigate phytoliths quantitatively (Si and Ca types), siliceous aggregates and spherulites. The properties of the archaeological samples were compared with these results. The archaeological char samples were used for identification and analysed using reflective microscopy to study structure and temperature by reflectance (%Ro). It provided the necessary information to determine the type of fuel used by the Iron Age farmers and obtain more information on the function of the present fire structures.

In tropical environments, such ceremonies are particularly salient despite widespread assumptions that water supplies are unproblematic in such regions. We demonstrate for the first time that two common but previously under-appreciated Maya rituals are likely planting and rain-beckoning rituals preferentially performed at certain times of the year in close step with the rainy season and the Maya agricultural cycle. We also argue for considerable historical continuity between these Classic Maya ceremonies and later Maya community rituals still performed in times of uncertain weather conditions up to the present day across Guatemala, Belize, and eastern Mexico. During the Terminal Classic period (AD 800-900), the changing role played by ancient Maya drought-related rituals fits into a wider rhetorical shift observed in Maya texts away from the more characteristic focus on royal births, enthronements, marriages, and wars towards greater emphasis on the correct perpetuation of key ceremonies, and we argue that such changes are consistent with palaeoclimatic evidence for a period of diminished precipitation and recurrent drought.",10.1007/s10745-018-0019-6,30363853,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:10:54.791376-04:00,No,,

However, without an appropriate understanding of the multiple factors impacting on water, mitigation measures cannot be targeted. Therefore, this paper addresses this gap in understanding, reporting the hydrochemical monitoring evidence collected from the UK Government's Demonstration Test Catchments (DTC) programme including contrasting chalk and clay/mudstone catchments. We use data collected at daily and sub-daily frequency over multiple sites to address: (1) How does the behaviour of the full range of nitrogen (N) species and phosphorus (P) fractions vary? (2) How do N species and P fractions vary inter- and intra-annually? (3) What do these data indicate about the primary pollution sources? And (4) which diffuse pollution mitigation measures are appropriate in our study landscapes? Key differences in the rates of flux of nutrients were identified, dependent on catchment characteristics. Full N speciation and P fractionation, together with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) enabled identification of the most likely contributing sources in each catchment. Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>-N) was the dominant N fraction in the chalk whereas organic and particulate N comprised the majority of the load in the clay/mudstone catchments. Despite current legislation, orthophosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>-P) was not found to be the dominant form of P in any of the catchments monitored. The chalk sub-catchments had the largest proportion of inorganic/dissolved organic P (DOP), accompanied by episodic delivery of particulate P (PP). Contrastingly, the clay/mudstone sub-catchments loads were dominated by PP and DOP. Thus, our results show that by monitoring both the inorganic and organic fractions a more complete picture of catchment nutrient fluxes can be determined, and sources of pollution pin-pointed. Ultimately, policy and management to bring nutrient impacts under control will only be successful if a multi-stressor approach is adopted.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.190,30340264,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:05:05.674939-04:00,No,,

Similar model-based quantitative reconstruction of plant cover in China has been restricted due to the lack of standardized datasets of existing estimates of relative pollen productivity (RPP). This study presents the first synthesis of all RPP values available to date for 39 major plant taxa from temperate China and proposes standardized RPP datasets that can be used for model-based quantitative reconstructions of past plant cover using fossil pollen records for the region. We review 11 RPP studies in temperate China based on modern pollen and related vegetation data around the pollen samples. The study areas include meadow, steppe and desert vegetation, various woodland types, and cultural landscapes. We evaluate the strategies of each study in terms of selection of study areas and distribution of study sites; pollen- and vegetation-data collection in field; vegetation-data collection from satellite images and vegetation maps; and data analysis. We compare all available RPP estimates, select values based on precise rules and calculate mean RPP estimates. We propose two standardized RPP datasets for 31 (Alt1) and 29 (Alt2) plant taxa. The ranking of mean RPPs (Alt-2) relative to Poaceae (= 1) for eight major taxa is: <i>Artemisia</i> (21) &gt; <i>Pinus</i> (18.4) &gt; <i>Betula</i> (12.5) &gt; <i>Castanea</i> (11.5) &gt; Elaeagnaceae (8.8) &gt; <i>Juglans</i> (7.5) &gt; Compositae (4.5) &gt; Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae (4).

Two cases of elderly patients who developed PE while they were undergoing inpatient treatment for depression are presented. This is discussed using the vascular and the cytokine hypotheses of depression as an explanatory framework. Both patients showed significant clinical improvement in their mental state following therapeutic enoxaparin despite no other changes to their management of depression. This observed benefit of enoxaparin can be explained by the vascular hypothesis of LLD, and possibly the cytokine hypothesis of major depression.

Combined with the archaeological evidence, we suggest that their most plausible origin lies in west Wales, the source of the bluestones erected in the early stage of the monument's construction.

Originating from the Great Lakes, the Canadian Maritimes, and the Appalachian Mountains, Archaic-age copper is found in significant amounts as far south as Tennessee and in isolated pockets at major trade centers in Louisiana but is absent from most of the southeastern United States. Here we report the discovery of a copper band found with the cremated remains of at least seven individuals buried in the direct center of a Late Archaic shell ring located in coastal Georgia. Late Archaic shell rings are massive circular middens thought to be constructed, in part, during large-scale ritual gatherings and feasting events. The exotic copper and cremated remains are unique in coastal South Carolina and Georgia where Archaic-age cremations are conspicuously absent and no other Archaic copper objects have been reported. Elemental data produced through laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry shows the copper originated from the Great Lakes, effectively extending Archaic copper exchange almost 1,000 km beyond its traditional boundaries. Similarities in mortuary practices and the presence of copper originating from the Great Lakes reveal the presence of long-distance exchange relations spanning vast portions of the eastern United States and suggest an unexpected level of societal complexity at shell ring localities. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that elite actors solidified their positions through ritual gatherings and the long-distance exchange of exotic objects during the Archaic.",10.1073/pnas.1808819115,30061396,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-11 23:32:15.485166-04:00,No,,

The study aimed to confirm or disconfirm archaeological and linguistic data indicating that the region's populations underwent diversification as a result of the spread of agropastoral food-producing subsistence lifestyles, over time dividing the region into separate areas of nomadic pastoralism, on the one hand, and sedentary farming, on the other. To perform both descriptive and coalescence analyses from the Sahel/Savannah belt's entire region, including western and eastern rather than just central populations studied previously, we generated a new mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data set not only having almost 2,000 samples (875 of which were newly collected) but also encompassing whole mtDNA D-loop segment rather than only the previously studied hypervariable segment 1. While comparing our analyses with previous results from the Lake Chad Basin (central Sahel/Savannah Belt), we found similar intrapopulation diversity measures (i.e., lower values in pastoralists than in farmers). However, the new data set pointed to significant differences in mating strategies between western and eastern pastoralists: our results suggest higher gene flow between the Arabic pastoralists and neighboring farmers in the eastern part than between the Fulani pastoralists and their sedentary neighbors in the western part of the Sahel/Savannah belt. The findings are discussed in light of archaeological and linguistic data, allowing us to postulate that the genetic differentiation of Fulani pastoralists from the common western African agropastoral gene pool occurred at around the same time as the arrival of the Arabic pastoralists to eastern Africa. However, it seems that while the process of divergence of the Fulani pastoralists in the west was accompanied by a loss of Fulani females to other populations, the Arab pastoralists' immigration to the Sahel/Savannah belt conversely resulted in some gain of local females into this Arab population.",,30047317,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:04:49.673215-04:00,No,,

As with the preceding Magdalenian, the burial of more than two individuals in the same grave cutting seems to be unusual, but does occur occasionally. The deposition of isolated and disarticulated human remains with or without cut marks seems additionally to belong to the Magdalenian context. In the final Palaeolithic phase (13 000-11 600 cal years BP) there is evidence for cemetery-like clusters of burials, which contrast to the Magdalenian evidence, instead showing some similarities with the succeeding Mesolithic. The earliest Mesolithic burials 11 600-10 500 cal BP) are a very rare phenomenon, covering a short time span between the beginning of the Preboreal and the beginning of the Boreal phase of the early Holocene.

Pottery containers first emerged in East Asia during the Late Pleistocene in a wide range of environmental settings, but became particularly prominent and much more widely dispersed after climatic warming at the start of the Holocene. Some archaeologists argue that this increasing usage was driven by environmental factors, as warmer climates would have generated a wider range of terrestrial plant and animal resources that required processing in pottery. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tested. Here, in one of the largest studies of its kind, we conducted organic residue analysis of &gt;800 pottery vessels selected from 46 Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene sites located across the Japanese archipelago to identify their contents. Our results demonstrate that pottery had a strong association with the processing of aquatic resources, irrespective of the ecological setting. Contrary to expectations, this association remained stable even after the onset of Holocene warming, including in more southerly areas, where expanding forests provided new opportunities for hunting and gathering. Nevertheless, the results indicate that a broader array of aquatic resources was processed in pottery after the start of the Holocene. We suggest this marks a significant change in the role of pottery of hunter-gatherers, corresponding to an increased volume of production, greater variation in forms and sizes, the rise of intensified fishing, the onset of shellfish exploitation, and reduced residential mobility.",10.1073/pnas.1803782115,30012598,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:18:38.332136-04:00,No,,

When communism and religion variables are included, cultural ancestry is no longer a significant predictor; communism significantly negatively predicts HDI, income and health indices, and Muslim percentage of the population significantly negatively predicts education index, although the latter result may not be robust.

The study was conducted for 4&#xa0;months (January-April 2015) in the dry season and 69 foods were collected for nutritional analyses. N. annamensis fed on 37 plant species, but only seven species made up more than 80% of feeding time. N. annamensis spent the majority of their time feeding on fruit (60.36%), followed by young leaves (22.60%), flowers (13.74%), and mature leaves (3.30%). Fruit had the highest concentrations of total non-structural carbohydrates, while young leaves had the highest concentration of crude protein compared to other food items. All food items had similar concentrations of lipids, except young leaves, which had lower levels than fruit and flowers. All plant parts consumed by N. annamensis had similar amounts of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and acid detergent lignin. Thirty-two percent of all food items contained condensed tannins, and they had a similar level of it. All foods also had similar energy contents.

Excavated originally by Ian Glover in 1975, this limestone rock-shelter in the Maros karsts of Sulawesi, Indonesia, has long held significance in our understanding of early human dispersals into 'Wallacea', the vast zone of oceanic islands between continental Asia and Australia. We present new stratigraphic information and dating evidence from Leang Burung 2 collected during the course of our excavations at this site in 2007 and 2011-13. Our findings suggest that the classic Late Pleistocene modern human occupation sequence identified previously at Leang Burung 2, and proposed to span around 31,000 to 19,000 conventional 14C years BP (~35-24 ka cal BP), may actually represent an amalgam of reworked archaeological materials. Sources for cultural materials of mixed ages comprise breccias from the rear wall of the rock-shelter-remnants of older, eroded deposits dated to 35-23 ka cal BP-and cultural remains of early Holocene antiquity. Below the upper levels affected by the mass loss of Late Pleistocene deposits, our deep-trench excavations uncovered evidence for an earlier hominin presence at the site. These findings include fossils of now-extinct proboscideans and other 'megafauna' in stratified context, as well as a cobble-based stone artifact technology comparable to that produced by late Middle Pleistocene hominins elsewhere on Sulawesi.",10.1371/journal.pone.0193025,29641524,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:10:27.551222-04:00,No,,

The elevated nitrogen isotope values of the millet grains (5500-3500&#x2009;cal BP) in comparison with the estimated local vegetation indicates that millets were organically manured by animal dung, mostly likely originating from domestic pigs.

To compare the potential for pathogenic aDNA retrieval from teeth and petrous bones, we sampled these elements from five ancient skeletons, previously shown to be carrying <i>Yersinia pestis</i>. Based on shotgun sequencing data, four of these five plague victims showed clearly detectable levels of <i>Y.&#xa0;pestis</i> DNA in the teeth, whereas all the petrous bones failed to produce <i>Y.&#xa0;pestis</i> DNA above baseline levels. A broader comparative metagenomic analysis of teeth and petrous bones from 10 historical skeletons corroborated these results, showing a much higher microbial diversity in teeth than petrous bones, including pathogenic and oral microbial taxa. Our results imply that although petrous bones are highly valuable for ancient genomic analyses as an excellent source of endogenous DNA, the metagenomic potential of these dense skeletal elements is highly limited.

The spread of the domesticated form in Europe occurred much later, primarily mediated by Greek and Phoenician traders and afterward by Romans who introduced cats to Western and Central Europe around 2000 years ago. We investigated mtDNA of Holocene Felis remains and provide evidence of an unexpectedly early presence of cats bearing the Near Eastern wildcat mtDNA haplotypes in Central Europe, being ahead of Roman period by over 2000 years. The appearance of the Near Eastern wildcats in Central Europe coincides with the peak of Neolithic settlement density, moreover most of those cats belonged to the same mtDNA lineages as those domesticated in the Near East. Thus, although we cannot fully exclude that the Near Eastern wildcats appeared in Central Europe as a result of introgression with European wildcat, our findings support the hypothesis that the Near Eastern wildcats spread across Europe together with the first farmers, perhaps as commensal animals. We also found that cats dated to the Neolithic period belonged to different mtDNA lineages than those brought to Central Europe in Roman times, this supports the hypothesis that the gene pool of contemporary European domestic cats might have been established from two different source populations that contributed in different periods.",10.1038/s41437-018-0071-4,29588507,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:10:46.994171-04:00,No,,

Our ability to retrieve DNA from a larger number of Neanderthal individuals has been limited by poor preservation of endogenous DNA and contamination of Neanderthal skeletal remains by large amounts of microbial and present-day human DNA. Here we use hypochlorite treatment of as little as 9 mg of bone or tooth powder to generate between 1- and 2.7-fold genomic coverage of five Neanderthals who lived around 39,000 to 47,000 years ago (that is, late Neanderthals), thereby doubling the number of Neanderthals for which genome sequences are available. Genetic similarity among late Neanderthals is well predicted by their geographical location, and comparison to the genome of an older Neanderthal from the Caucasus indicates that a population turnover is likely to have occurred, either in the Caucasus or throughout Europe, towards the end of Neanderthal history. We find that the bulk of Neanderthal gene flow into early modern humans originated from one or more source populations that diverged from the Neanderthals that were studied here at least 70,000 years ago, but after they split from a previously sequenced Neanderthal from Siberia around 150,000 years ago.

We measured the corpus of their fourth lumbar vertebra using magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine at the age of 46.

Bringing together insights from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, archaeology and behavioural ecology, we hypothesize that this singular occurrence was triggered by exaptation, or 'hijacking', of existing cognitive mechanisms related to sequential processing and motor execution. Observed coupling of the communication system with circuits related to complex action planning and control supports this proposition, but the prehistoric ecological contexts in which this coupling may have occurred and its adaptive value remain elusive. Evolutionary reasoning rules out most existing hypotheses regarding the ecological context of language evolution, which focus on ultimate explanations and ignore proximate mechanisms. Coupling of communication and motor systems, although possible in a short period on evolutionary timescales, required a multi-stepped adaptive process, involving multiple genes and gene networks. We suggest that the behavioural context that exerted the selective pressure to drive these sequential adaptations had to be one in which each of the systems undergoing coupling was <i>independently</i> necessary or highly beneficial, as well as frequent and recurring over evolutionary time. One such context could have been the teaching of tool production or tool use. In the present study, we propose the Cognitive Coupling hypothesis, which brings together these insights and outlines a unifying theory for the evolution of the capacity for language.This article is part of the theme issue 'Bridging cultural gaps: interdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution'.",10.1098/rstb.2017.0052,29440518,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 12:11:56.089621-04:00,No,,

However, from the death of the individual onwards, bones undergo several taphonomic and diagenetic processes that cause the alteration of their microstructure and composition. A detailed study on bone diagenesis has the double purpose to assess the preservation state of archaeological bones and to understand the alteration pathways, thus providing evidence that may contribute to evaluate the reliability of the retrieved information. On these bases, this research aims to explore the effectiveness of Raman hyperspectral imaging to detect types, extent and spatial distribution of diagenetic alteration at the micro-scale level. An early-Holocene bone sample from the Al Khiday cemetery (Khartoum, Sudan) was here analysed. Parameters related to the collagen content, bioapatite crystallinity and structural carbonate content, and to the occurrence of secondary mineral phases were calculated from Raman spectra. The acquired data provided spatially-resolved information on both the preservation state of bone constituents and the diagenetic processes occurring during burial. Given the minimal sample preparation, the easy and fast data acquisition and the improvement of system configurations, micro-Raman spectroscopy can be extensively applied as a screening method on a large set of samples in order to characterise the preservation state of archaeological bones. This technique can be effectively applied to identify suitable and well preserved portions of the analysed sample on which perform further analyses.",10.1016/j.talanta.2017.10.059,29310218,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 17:41:32.560302-04:00,No,,

Recently, new data on seed impressions on Butana Group pottery, from the fourth millennium BC in the southern Atbai region of the far eastern Sahelian Belt in Africa, show evidence for cultivation activities of sorghum displaying some domestication traits. <i>Pennisetum glaucum</i> may have been undergoing domestication shortly thereafter in the western Sahel, as finds of fully domesticated pearl millet are present in southeastern Mali by the second half of the third millennium BC, and present in eastern Sudan by the early second millennium BC. The dispersal of the latter to India took less than 1000&#xa0;years according to present data.

While there are growing efforts to better understand mechanisms of anthelmintic resistance in human and animal populations, it is unclear how resistance mechanisms that alter susceptibility to one drug affect the interactions and efficacy of drugs used in combination. Mutations that alter drug permeability across primary nematode barriers have been identified as potential resistance mechanisms using the model nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> . We leveraged high-throughput assays in this model system to measure altered anthelmintic susceptibility in response to genetic perturbations of potential cuticular, amphidial, and alimentary routes of drug entry. Mutations in genes associated with these tissue barriers differentially altered susceptibility to the major anthelmintic classes (macrocyclic lactones, benzimidazoles, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists) as measured by animal development. We investigated two-way anthelmintic interactions across <i>C. elegans</i> genetic backgrounds that confer resistance or hypersensitivity to one or more drugs. We observe that genetic perturbations that alter susceptibility to a single drug can shift the drug interaction landscape and lead to the appearance of novel synergistic and antagonistic interactions.

L-asparagine is a non-essential amino acid, which means that it can be synthesized by the body and is not required to be obtained through the diet. The synthesis of L-asparagine occurs primarily in the liver, but it also takes place in other tissues throughout the body. In contrast, leukemic cells cannot synthesize L-asparagine due the absence of L-asparagine synthetase and should obtain it from circulating sources for protein synthesis and cell division processes to ensure their vital functions. L-ASP catalyzes the deamination process of L-asparagine amino-acid into aspartic acid and ammonia, depriving leukemic cells of asparagine. This leads to decreased protein synthesis and cell division in tumor cells. However, using L-ASP has side effects, such as hypersensitivity or allergic reaction, antigenicity, short half-life, temporary blood clearance, and toxicity. L-ASP immobilization can minimize the side effects of L-ASP by stopping the immune system from attacking non-human enzymes and improving the enzyme's performance. The first strategy includes modification of enzyme structure, such as covalent binding (conjugation), adsorption to the support material and cross-linking of the enzyme. The chemical modification of residues, often nonspecific, changes the enzyme's hydrophobicity and surface charge, lowering the enzyme's activity. Also, the first strategy exposes the enzyme's surface to the environment. This eliminates its performance and does not allow targeted delivery of the enzyme. The second strategy is based on the entrapment of the enzyme inside the protecting structure or encapsulation. This strategy offers the same benefits as the first. Still, it also enables reducing toxicity, prolonging in vivo half-life, enhancing stability and activity, enables a targeted delivery and controlled release of the enzyme. Compared to the first strategy, encapsulation does not modify the chemical structure of the enzyme since L-ASP is only effective against leukemia in its native tetrameric form. This review aims to present state of the art in L-ASP formulations developed for reducing the side effects of L-ASP, focusing on describing improvements in their safety. The primary focus in the field remains to be improving the overall performance of the L-ASP formulations. Almost all encapsulation systems allow reducing immune response due to screening the enzyme from antibodies and prolonging its half-life. However, the enzyme's activity and stability depend on the encapsulation system type. Therefore, the selection of the right encapsulation system is crucial in therapy due to its effect on the performance parameters of the L-ASP. Biodegradable and biocompatible materials, such as chitosan, alginate and liposomes, mainly attract the researcher's interest in enzyme encapsulation. The research trends are also moving towards developing formulations with targeted delivery and increased selectivity.",10.1016/j.cis.2023.102915,37159987,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:37:58.485952-04:00,No,,
14822,The ATR-WEE1 kinase module promotes SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 translation to activate replication stress responses.,,,,,,The Plant cell,Plant Cell,09,05,2023,"DNA replication stress threatens genome stability and is a hallmark of cancer in humans. The evolutionarily conserved kinases ATR (ATM and RAD3-related) and WEE1 are essential for the activation of replication stress responses. Translational control is an important mechanism that regulates gene expression, but its role in replication stress responses is largely unknown. Here we show that ATR-WEE1 control the translation of SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 (SOG1), a master transcription factor required for replication stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through genetic screening, we found that the loss of GENERAL CONTROL NONDEREPRESSIBLE 20 (GCN20) or GCN1, which function together to inhibit protein translation, suppressed the hypersensitivity of the atr or wee1 mutant to replication stress. Biochemically, WEE1 inhibits GCN20 by phosphorylating it; phosphorylated GCN20 is subsequently polyubiquitinated and degraded. Ribosome profiling experiments revealed that that loss of GCN20 enhanced the translation efficiency of SOG1, while overexpressing GCN20 had the opposite effect. The loss of SOG1 reduced the resistance of wee1 gcn20 to replication stress, whereas overexpressing SOG1 enhanced the resistance to atr or wee1 to replication stress. These results suggest that ATR-WEE1 inhibits GCN20-GCN1 activity to promote the translation of SOG1 during replication stress. These findings link translational control to replication stress responses in Arabidopsis.",10.1093/plcell/koad126,37159556,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 14:38:26.076566-04:00,No,,

However, the mechanisms that link airway inflammation to the structural changes that define asthma are incompletely understood. Using a human model of allergen-induced asthma exacerbation, we compared the lower airway mucosa in allergic asthmatics and allergic non-asthmatic controls using single-cell RNA sequencing. In response to allergen, the asthmatic airway epithelium was highly dynamic and up-regulated genes involved in matrix degradation, mucus metaplasia, and glycolysis while failing to induce injury-repair and antioxidant pathways observed in controls. <i>IL9</i>-expressing pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cells were specific to asthmatic airways and were only observed after allergen challenge. Additionally, conventional type 2 dendritic cells (DC2 that express <i>CD1C</i>) and <i>CCR2</i>-expressing monocyte-derived cells (MCs) were uniquely enriched in asthmatics after allergen, with up-regulation of genes that sustain type 2 inflammation and promote pathologic airway remodeling. In contrast, allergic controls were enriched for macrophage-like MCs that up-regulated tissue repair programs after allergen challenge, suggesting that these populations may protect against asthmatic airway remodeling. Cellular interaction analyses revealed a T<sub>H</sub>2-mononuclear phagocyte-basal cell interactome unique to asthmatics. These pathogenic cellular circuits were characterized by type 2 programming of immune and structural cells and additional pathways that may sustain and amplify type 2 signals, including TNF family signaling, altered cellular metabolism, failure to engage antioxidant responses, and loss of growth factor signaling.

Eighteen healthy domestic dogs with no anti-Leishmania antibodies and negative leishmanin skin test (LST) were randomly inoculated intravenously with either L. infantum (LiCen<sup>-/-</sup>) vaccine candidate in 10 dogs or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in 8 dogs. The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy rate of L. infantum (LiCen<sup>-/-</sup>) vaccine candidate against CanL were evaluated by different criteria, including clinical manifestations, injection-site lesion, hematology and biochemistry values, anti-Leishmania antibodies using direct agglutination test (DAT), delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) using LST, and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells subsets, as well as by measuring interferon (IFN-&#x3b3;), interleukin (IL-23), IL-17, and IL-10 cytokines. Spleen aspiration and detection of Leishmania parasite using parasitological examinations (microscopy and culture) were performed in both vaccinated and control groups. Two months after intervention, each dog was challenged intraperitoneally (IP) with wide type (WT) L. infantum.

No consensus diagnostic criterion exists. TSW is frequently interpreted as flaring of the underlying disorder or contact allergy to topical treatment. To better characterise TSW symptomatology, detail our experience with management, and assess the proportion of patients who pursue nonconventional management. A retrospective review of case notes collected from our multidisciplinary service between January 2019 and June 2021 was carried out to identify patients presenting with TSW. Nineteen cases of TSW were identified, 15 females and four males. The majority were under 35&#x2005;years old. Eighteen had atopic dermatitis. The most frequently reported features were redness, skin pain (typically 'burning'), skin sensitivity, excessive skin flaking, insomnia, and severe itching. There was a high burden of anxiety and depression, with three patients expressing suicidal thoughts. Nonconventional treatments were pursued by approximately half the cohort, some of whom sought private consultation with international dermatologists. Improvements were noted in the context of open psychodermatology consultations with an earlier introduction of conventional management options. Many patients report dismissal by dermatology healthcare professionals, often driving them to seek help from unregulated online sources, heightening the burden of mental, social and physical morbidity.

However, with an advent of molecular diagnostic methods, an increasing number of reports placed them among the pathogens found in the lower respiratory tract and recognized them as important risk factors for asthma-related pathology in childhood. As the spread of rhinovirus was not severely affected by the implementation of social distancing and other measures during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, its putative pathogenic role has become even more evident in recent years.

The disease has been linked to several infectious factors, but data on the direct presence of microorganisms in the lesions of PN are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity and composition of the bacterial microbiome in PN lesions by targeting the region V3-V4 of 16S rRNA. Skin swabs were obtained from active nodules in 24 patients with PN, inflammatory patches of 14 patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and corresponding skin areas of 9 healthy volunteers (HV). After DNA extraction, the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina platform on the MiSeq instrument. Operational taxonomic units (OTU) were identified. The identification of taxa was carried out using the Silva v.138 database. There was no statistically significant difference in the alpha-diversity (intra-sample diversity) between the PN, AD and HV groups. The beta-diversity (inter-sample diversity) showed statistically significant differences between the three groups on a global level and in paired analyses. <i>Staphylococcus</i> was significantly more abundant in samples from PN and AD patients than in controls. The difference was maintained across all taxonomic levels. The PN microbiome is highly similar to that of AD. It remains unclear whether the disturbed composition of the microbiome and the domination of <i>Staphylococcus</i> in PN lesions may be the trigger factor of pruritus and lead to the development of cutaneous changes or is a secondary phenomenon.

Noxious stimuli in the colorectum of anesthetized male rats enhance colorectal motility by activating monoaminergic neurons in descending pain inhibitory pathways from the brainstem to the lumbosacral spinal cord. These monoaminergic neurons release serotonin and dopamine into the lumbosacral spinal cord, resulting in the increment of colorectal motility. In female rats, in contrast, noxious stimuli in the colorectum have no effect on colorectal motility. We clarified that GABAergic inhibition in the lumbosacral spinal cord masks the enhancement of colorectal motility induced by monoamines in female animals.

Alignment was carried out among human proteins associated with urticaria (9 proteins), type 1 gNET (32 proteins), and H. pylori proteome. We performed pairwise alignment among the human and H. pylori antigens with PSI-BLAST. Modeling based on homology was done with the Swiss model server and epitope prediction with the Ellipro server. Epitopes were located on a 3D model using PYMOL software. The highest conserved sequence was found between the human HSP 60 antigen and the H. pylori chaperonin GroEL with an identity of 54% and a cover of 92%, followed by the alpha and gamma enolases and two H. pylori phosphopyruvate hydratase, both with an identity and cover of 48% and 96%, respectively. The H/K ATPase (Chain A) showed high identity with two H. pylori proteins (35.21% with both P-type ATPase), but with low cover (only 6%). We observed eight linear and three discontinuous epitopes for human HSP 60 and three lineal and one discontinuous epitope for both alpha-enolase and gamma enolase, high conserved with H. pylori sequences. Some type 1 gNET antigens shared potential cross-reactive epitopes with H. pylori proteins, suggesting that molecular mimicry could be a mechanism that explains the relationship between the infection and this disease.

The study included nonhospitalized patients 12 years and older with a positive COVID-19 laboratory test collected between November 9, 2020, and January 31, 2022, who met at least 1 emergency use authorization criterion for risk of a poor outcome. Four nMAb products (bamlanivimab, bamlanivimab-etesevimab, casirivimab-imdevimab, and sotrovimab) administered in the outpatient setting. Clinical and SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data and propensity-adjusted marginal structural models were used to assess the association between treatment with nMAbs and 4 outcomes: all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization, death, and a composite of hospitalization or death within 14 days and 30 days of the index date (defined as the date of the first positive COVID-19 test or the date of referral).

Given the role of genetic variants in the differential expression of TGF-&#x3b2;1 in various diseases, this study seeks to ascertain the role of TGF-&#x3b2;1 promoter variants (rs1800469 and rs1800468) in AD susceptibility, as well as their association with TGF- &#x3b2;1 mRNA expression, TGF- &#x3b2;1 serum levels and skin prick test positivity in Atopic Dermatitis patients. An aggregate of 246 subjects including 134 AD cases and 112 matched healthy controls were genotyped for TGF-&#x3b2;1 promoter polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP. TGF- &#x3b2;1 mRNA was quantified by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR), Vitamin-D levels by chemiluminescence, and serum TGF- &#x3b2;1, and total IgE levels were determined by ELISA. In-vivo allergy testing was performed for the evaluation of allergic reactions to house dust mites and food allergens. A higher frequency of TT genotypes of rs1800469 (OR = 7.7, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0001) and GA+AA genotypes of rs1800468 (OR-4.4, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001) were observed in AD cases than those in controls. Haplotype analysis demonstrated that TG haplotype carriers had an increased risk of AD (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.013). Quantitative analysis revealed a significant upregulation of both mRNA (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0002) and serum levels (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001) of TGF- &#x3b2;1 with a substantial positive correlation between them (Correlation coefficient=0.504; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01).

Stratification analysis revealed that the TT genotype of rs1800469 was associated with higher IgE levels (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01) and eosinophil percentage(p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.007) whereas the AA genotype of rs1800468 correlated with elevated serum IgE levels (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.01). Besides, no significant association of genotypes with mRNA and serum expression of TGF-&#x3b2;1 was observed. Our study indicates that TGF-&#x3b2;1 promoter SNPs bear a significant risk of AD development. Moreover, upregulation of TGF-&#x3b2;1 mRNA and serum levels and their association with disease severity, quality of life, and HDM allergy suggests its role as a diagnostic/prognostic biomarker that could help in the development of new therapeutic and prevention strategies.",10.1016/j.molimm.2023.04.006,37084506,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:25:23.671148-04:00,No,,

Patients with SNM who underwent definitive treatment with curative intent were enrolled in a prospective, multisite, longitudinal observational study. QOL was assessed using the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) and University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UWQOL) instruments at pretreatment baseline and multiple follow-ups through 5 years posttreatment. Multivariable modeling was used to determine demographic, disease, and treatment factors associated with disease-specific and generalized physical and social/emotional function QOL. One hundred ninety-four patients with SNM were analyzed. All QOL indices were impaired at pretreatment baseline and improved after treatment. SNOT-22 scores improved 3 months and UWQOL scores improved 6 to 9 months posttreatment.

Cell lines and animal models indicated that p.P522R is a functional hypermorph. We aimed to confirm this in human circulating peripheral immune cells. We compared effects of p.P522R on immune system function between carriers and non-carriers (aged 59-103y), using in-depth immunophenotyping, functional B-cell and myeloid cell assays, and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In line with expectations, p.P522R impacts immune cell function only slightly, but it does so across a wide array of immune cell types. Upon B-cell stimulation, we observed increased PLC&#x3b3;2 phosphorylation and calcium release, suggesting increased B-cell sensitivity upon antigen recognition. Further, p.P522R-carriers had higher numbers of CD20++CD21-CD24+ naive B cells and IgG1+ memory B cells. In myeloid cells, normalized ROS production was higher upon PLC&#x3b3;2-dependent stimulation. On classical monocytes, CD33 levels were elevated. Furthermore, carriers expressed lower levels of allergy-related Fc&#x3b5;RI on several immune cell subsets.

A comprehensive assessment of the prevalence of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 is essential. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of comorbidities, severity and mortality with regard to geographic region, age, gender and smoking status in patients with COVID-19. A systematic review and multistage meta-analyses were reported using PRISMA guidelines. PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and EMBASE were searched from January 2020 to October 2022. Cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, case series studies, and case-control studies on comorbidities reporting among the COVID-19 populations that were published in English were included. The pooled prevalence of various medical conditions in COVID-19 patients was calculated based on regional population size weights. Stratified analyses were performed to understand the variations in the medical conditions based on age, gender, and geographic region. A total of 190 studies comprising 105 million COVID-19 patients were included. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA software, version 16 MP (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

Blood and airway immune cells from 52 severe COVID-19 subjects were phenotyped by flow cytometry. Samples and clinical data were collected at two separate time points to assess changes during ICU stay. Blockade of type I interferon and IFIT3 signaling was performed in vitro to determine their contribution to viral clearance in A2 neutrophils. We identified two neutrophil subpopulations (A1 and A2) in the airway compartment, where loss of the A2 subset correlated with increased viral burden and reduced 30-days survival. A2 neutrophils showcased a discrete antiviral response with an increased interferon signature. Blockade of type I interferon attenuated viral clearance in A2 neutrophils and downregulated IFIT3 and key catabolic genes, demonstrating direct antiviral neutrophil function. Knockdown of IFIT3 in A2 neutrophils led to loss of IRF3 phosphorylation with consequent reduced viral catabolism, providing the first discrete mechanism of type I interferon signaling in neutrophils. The identification of this novel neutrophil phenotype and its association with severe COVID-19 outcomes emphasizes its likely importance in other respiratory viral infections and potential for new therapeutic approaches in viral illness.",10.1172/jci.insight.167042,37071484,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:00:00.950386-04:00,No,,

Data from two cross-sectional surveys conducted in 2009 and 2019 (401 and 513 children, respectively) were analyzed. The results of skin prick tests and information on food sensitization-related risk factors in children were summarized, including family history of atopic disease (FHA), demographic characteristics, method of delivery, feeding patterns, sibship size, pet ownership, and vitamin D supplementation.

Overall, 81,856 RUCAM based DILI cases have been published until mid of 2020, allowing now for an analysis of mechanistic issues of the disease. From selected DILI cases with verified diagnosis by using RUCAM, direct evidence was provided for the involvement of the innate and adapted immune system as well as genetic HLA (Human Leucocyte Antigen) genotypes. Direct evidence for a role of hepatic immune systems was substantiated by (1) the detection of anti-CYP (Cytochrome P450) isoforms in the plasma of affected patients, in line with the observation that 65% of the drugs most implicated in DILI are metabolized by a range of CYP isoforms, (2) the DIAIH (drug induced autoimmune hepatitis), a subgroup of idiosyncratic DILI, which is characterized by high RUCAM causality gradings and the detection of plasma antibodies such as positive serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA), rarely also anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA), (3) the effective treatment with glucocorticoids in part of an unselected RUCAM based DILI group, and (4) its rare association with the immune-triggered Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) caused by a small group of drugs. Direct evidence of a genetic basis of idiosyncratic DILI was shown by the association of several HLA genotypes for DILI caused by selected drugs. Finally, animal models of idiosyncratic DILI mimicking human immune and genetic features are not available and further search likely will be unsuccessful. In essence and based on cases of DILI with verified diagnosis using RUCAM for causality evaluation, there is now substantial direct evidence that immune mechanisms and genetics can account for idiosyncratic DILI by many but not all implicated drugs, which may help understand the mechanistic background of the disease and contribute to new approaches of therapy and prevention.",10.3390/ijms24076663,37047633,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:21:47.940555-04:00,No,,

However, the underlying mechanism has not been thoroughly elucidated. We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that low temperature reduces occludin expression and compromises epithelial barrier function in airways, which in turn, results in asthma exacerbation. We examined occludin expression in human bronchial epithelial cell line (Beas-2B) cells exposed to either 29&#xa0;&#xb0;C or 37&#xa0;&#xb0;C. The following drugs were administered prior to cold treatment: MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor), cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor), HC-067047 plus GSK2193874 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 [TRPV4] antagonists), or C4-ceramide (a glucocorticoid-inducible kinase [SGK1] activator). siNedd4-2 was transfected into Beas-2B cells to investigate the role that Nedd4-2 plays in mediating occludin instability induced by cold.

GSK2193874 or C4-ceramide was administered during the cold treatment. Occludin expression of the lung, pulmonary permeability, serum IgE levels, and lung inflammation were assessed. Low temperature treatment (29&#xa0;&#xb0;C) significantly reduced the expression of occludin in Beas-2B cells from 1 to 9&#xa0;h, which was rescued upon treatment with MG132, HC-067047 plus GSK2193874, C4-ceramide, or Nedd4-2 knockdown. Low temperatures affected occludin stability through SGK1/Nedd4-2-dependent proteolysis. In vivo mice data revealed that cold exposure compromised the airway epithelial barrier function, decreased occludin expression, and exacerbated lung inflammation, which was attenuated by the GSK2193874 or C4-ceramide injection.

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelial-derived cytokine that induces type 2 immune response through dendritic cell activation. Therefore, TSLP inhibitors may serve as novel antiallergic drugs. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activation in the epithelia contributes to several homeostatic phenomena, such as re-epithelialization. However, the effects of HIF activation on TSLP production and immune activation in the skin remain unclear. In this study, we found that selective HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (PHD inhibitors), which induce HIF activation, suppressed TSLP production in a mouse ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization model. PHD inhibitors also suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), which is a major inducer of TSLP production, in this mouse model and in a macrophage cell line. Consistent with these findings, PHD inhibitors suppressed OVA-specific IgE levels in the serum and OVA-induced allergic responses. Furthermore, we found a direct suppressive effect on TSLP expression in a human keratinocyte cell line mediated by HIF activation. Taken together, our findings suggest that PHD inhibitors exert antiallergic effects by suppressing TSLP production.

Typical quantitative scoring methods to evaluate structural changes of airway remodeling on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) are time-consuming and laborious. Thus, easier and simpler methods are required in clinical practice. We evaluated the clinical usefulness of a simple, semi-quantitative method based on 8 HRCT parameters by comparing asthmatics with a persistent decline of post-bronchodilator (BD)-FEV1 to those with a BD-FEV1 that normalized over time and evaluated the relationships of the parameters with BD-FEV1. Asthmatics (n = 59) were grouped into 5 trajectories (Trs) according to the changes of BD-FEV1 over 1 year. After 9-12 months of guideline-based treatment, HRCT parameters including emphysema, bronchiectasis, anthracofibrosis, bronchial wall thickening (BWT), fibrotic bands, mosaic attenuation on inspiration, air-trapping on expiration, and centrilobular nodules were classified as present (1) or absent (0) in 6 zones. The Tr5 group (n = 11) was older and exhibited a persistent decline in BD-FEV1. The Tr5 and Tr4 groups (n = 12), who had a lower baseline BD-FEV1 that normalized over time, had longer durations of asthma, frequent exacerbations, and higher doses of steroid use compared to the Tr1-3 groups (n = 36), who had a normal baseline BD-FEV1. The Tr5 group had higher emphysema and BWT scores than the Tr4 (<i>P</i> = 8.25E-04 and <i>P</i> = 0.044, respectively). Scores for the other 6 parameters were not significantly different among the Tr groups. BD-FEV1 was inversely correlated with the emphysema and BWT scores in multivariate analysis (<i>P</i> = 1.70E-04, <i>P</i> = 0.006, respectively). Emphysema and BWT are associated with airway remodeling in asthmatics.

Following intraperitoneal sensitization, mice were experimentally exposed to Schistosoma eggs by intravenous injection, either once or three times repeatedly. The phenotype was characterized by right heart catheterization and tissue analysis. Following intraperitoneal sensitization, a single intravenous Schistosoma egg exposure resulted in a PH phenotype that peaked at 7-14 days, followed by spontaneous resolution. Three sequential exposures resulted in a persistent PH phenotype. Inflammatory cytokines were not significantly different between mice exposed to one or three egg doses, but there was an increase in perivascular fibrosis in those who received three egg doses. Significant perivascular fibrosis was also observed in autopsy specimens from patients who died of this condition. Repeatedly exposing mice to schistosomiasis causes a persistent PH phenotype, accompanied by perivascular fibrosis.

The present work explores the molecular mechanisms underpinning these observations using transcriptomics of the sinus mucosa. Epithelial brushings collected prospectively as a sub-study of the <i>L. lactis W136</i> clinical trial were used to probe epithelial responses to microbiome supplementation using a hypothesis-free bioinformatic analysis of gene expression analysis. Samples from twenty-four patients with CRS refractory to medical and surgical management were prospectively collected during a clinical trial assessing the effect of 14 days of BID nasal irrigation with 1.2 billion CFU of live <i>L. lactis W136</i> probiotic bacteria (CRSwNP&#x2009;=&#x2009;17, CRSsNP&#x2009;=&#x2009;7).

Differential gene expression was calculated, and pathway enrichment analysis was performed to identify potentially implicated processes. Differentially identified transcripts and pathways were assessed for the overall population and the clinical phenotypes of CRSwNP and CRSsNP. Patterns of response to treatment were similar across all groups, implicating pathways for the regulation of immunity and epithelial cell regulation. These resemble the patterns of improvement observed following successful treatment with endoscopic sinus surgery or azithromycin. Gene expression profiling following the application of live bacteria to the diseased sinus epithelium highlights the implication of multiple components of the inflammation-microbiome-epithelial barrier axis implicated in CRS.

Data on the antioxidant capacity of diet in children with food allergies, who are on an avoidance diet, are still lacking. This pilot study aims to assess the antioxidant potential of diet in Italian children with food allergies, compared to healthy children, using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. 95 children (54 with confirmed food allergies and 41 controls), with a median age of 7.8&#x2009;years, were enrolled and underwent a nutritional assessment.

Additionally, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has been reported to protect against pain hypersensitivity in central neuropathic pain. Hence, this research probed the impact of SAHA on pain sensitization in central neuropathic pain after SCI via the HDAC5/NEDD4/SCN9A axis. After SAHA treatment, SCI modeling, and gain- and loss-of-function assays, behavioral analysis was performed in mice to evaluate pain hypersensitivity and anxiety/depression-like behaviors. The enrichment of H3K27Ac in the NEDD4 promoter and the ubiquitination of SCN9A were measured with ChIP and Co-IP assays, respectively. The treatment of SAHA regained paw withdrawal threshold and paw withdrawal latency values, entry time and numbers in the center area, and entry proportion in the open arm for SCI mice, accompanied by decreases in immobility time, eating latency, thermal hyperalgesia, and mechanical ectopic pain. However, SAHA treatment did not affect the motor function of mice. SAHA treatment lowered HDAC5 expression and SCN9A protein expression in SCI mice, as well as enhanced SCN9A ubiquitination and NEDD4 expression. HDAC5 knockdown greatly increased H3K27Ac enrichment in the NEDD4 promoter. NEDD4 upregulation or HDAC5 knockdown elevated SCN9A ubiquitination but diminished SCN9A protein expression in dorsal root ganglions of SCI mice. NEDD4 silencing mitigated the improving effects of SAHA treatment on the pain hypersensitivity and anxiety/depression-like behaviors of SCI mice. SAHA suppressed HDAC5 to augment NEDD4 expression and SCN9A degradation, thereby ameliorating the pain hypersensitivity and anxiety/depression-like behaviors of SCI mice.",10.1007/s11064-023-03913-z,37002470,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:53:17.182287-04:00,No,,

We performed a blinded, randomized-controlled study in mice pretreated with 3-deacyl 6-acyl phosphorylated hexaacyl disaccharide (PHAD), a synthetic Toll-like receptor 4 agonist. Two cohorts of male BALB/c mice received intravenous vehicle or PHAD (2, 20, or 200 &#xb5;g) at 48 and 24 h before unilateral renal pedicle clamping and simultaneous contralateral nephrectomy. A separate cohort of mice received intravenous vehicle or 200 &#xb5;g PHAD followed by bilateral IRI-AKI. Mice were monitored for evidence of kidney injury for 3 days postreperfusion. Kidney function was assessed by serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine measurements. Kidney tubular injury was assessed by semiquantitative analysis of tubular morphology on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-stained kidney sections and by kidney mRNA quantification of injury [neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>Ngal</i>), kidney injury molecule-1 (<i>Kim-1</i>), and heme oxygenase-1 (<i>Ho-1</i>)] and inflammation [interleukin-6 (<i>IL-6</i>), interleukin-1&#x3b2; (<i>IL-1&#x3b2;</i>), and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (<i>Tnf-&#x3b1;</i>)] using quantitative RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify proximal tubular cell injury and renal macrophages by quantifying the areas stained with Kim-1 and F4/80 antibodies, respectively, and TUNEL staining to detect the apoptotic nuclei. PHAD pretreatment yielded dose-dependent kidney function preservation after unilateral IRI-AKI. Histological injury, apoptosis, Kim-1 staining, and <i>Ngal</i> mRNA were lower in PHAD-treated mice and <i>IL-1&#x3b2;</i> mRNA was higher in PHAD-treated mice.

We generated a recombinant VEE-VRP (Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis-derived replicon particle) vector-expressing modified rat BORIS lacking a DNA-binding domain (VRP-mBORIS). Rats were inoculated with the 13762 cells, immunized with VRP-mBORIS 48 h later, and then, subsequently, boosted at 10-day intervals. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Cured rats were re-challenged with the same 13762 cells. We demonstrated that BORIS was expressed in a small population of the 13762 cells, called cancer stem cells. Treatment of rats with VRP-BORIS suppressed tumor growth leading to its complete disappearance in up to 50% of the rats and significantly improved their survival. This improvement was associated with the induction of BORIS-specific cellular immune responses measured by T-helper cell proliferation and INF&#x3b3; secretion. The re-challenging of cured rats with the same 13762 cells indicated that the immune response prevented tumor growth. Thus, a therapeutic vaccine against rat BORIS showed high efficacy in treating the rat 13762 carcinoma.

Clinical features depend on the localization and level of infection: asymptomatic or with signs related to hypersensitivity, organic functional deficiencies, expanding mass effects, cyst infection and sudden death. In rare cases, the rupture of a hydatid cyst causes emboli formation by the residual laminated membrane.

(3) Results: Imaging investigations revealed the source of the emboli as the rupture of a hydatid cyst, the patient presenting multiple pericardial and mediastinal localizations. Cerebral imaging confirmed an acute left occipital ischemic lesion, with complete recovery of the neurological deficit after therapy, while surgery for acute brachial artery ischemia had a favorable postoperative evolution. Specific anthelmintic therapy was initiated.

High prevalence and morbidity have been observed in some regions, particularly marginalized urban populations. Research over the past 10&#xa0;years from LA has shown that childhood disease is primarily non-atopic. The attenuation of atopy may be explained by enhanced immune regulation induced by intense exposures to environmental factors such as childhood infections and poor environmental conditions of the urban poor. Non-atopic symptoms are associated with environmental and lifestyle factors including poor living conditions, respiratory infections, psychosocial stress, obesity, and a diet of highly processed foods. Ancestry (particularly African) and genetic factors increase asthma risk, and some of these factors may be specific to LA settings. Asthma in LA tends to be poorly controlled and depends on access to health care and medications. There is a need to improve management and access to medication through primary health care.

While research for specific treatment options continues in patients who cannot tolerate or are unresponsive to aspirin treatment after aspirin desensitization (ATAD), biologicals have emerged as a new therapeutic option in NERD patients. The aim of this study was to compare the quality of life, and the sinonasal and respiratory outcomes of NERD patients treated with ATAD or biologicals. Patients who have been followed up at a tertiary care allergy center and who have been receiving at least one of ATAD, mepolizumab or omalizumab for at least six months were included. Evaluations were made using sinonasal outcome test (SNOT-22), asthma control test (ACT), short form-36 (SF-36), blood eosinophil counts, need for recurrent functional endoscopic sinus surgeries (FESS), and asthma or rhinitis exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS). A total of 59 patients comprised of 35 (59%) females and 24 (41%) males with a mean age of 46.1 (min-max, 20-70) years were included.

In the clinic, responses are interrogated by assessment of vaccination responses, which is central to many PAD diagnoses. However, the composition of the generated antibody repertoire is concealed from traditional quantitative measures of serological responses. Leveraging modern mass spectrometry-based proteomics (MS-proteomics), it is possible to elaborate the molecular features of specific antibody repertoires, which may address current limitations of diagnostic vaccinology. We sought to evaluate serum antibody responses in patients with PAD following vaccination with a neo-antigen (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 vaccination) using MS-proteomics. Following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 vaccination, serological responses in individuals with PAD and healthy controls (HCs) were assessed by anti-S1 subunit ELISA and neutralization assays. Purified anti-S1 subunit IgG and IgM was profiled by MS-proteomics for IGHV subfamily usage and somatic hypermutation analysis. Twelve patients with PAD who were vaccine-responsive were recruited with 11 matched vaccinated HCs. Neutralization and end point anti-S1 titers were lower in PAD. All subjects with PAD demonstrated restricted anti-S1 IgG antibody repertoires, with usage of &lt;5 IGHV subfamilies (median: 3; range 2-4), compared to &#x2265;5 for the 11 HC subjects (P&#xa0;&lt; .001). IGHV3-7 utilization was far less common in patients with PAD than in HCs (2 of 12 vs 10 of 11; P&#xa0;= .001). Amino acid substitutions due to somatic hypermutation per subfamily did not differ between groups. Anti-S1 IgM was present in 64% and 50% of HC and PAD cohorts, respectively, and did not differ significantly between HCs and patients with PAD. This study demonstrates the breadth of anti-S1 antibodies elicited by vaccination at the proteome level and identifies stereotypical restriction of IGHV utilization in the IgG repertoire in patients with PAD compared with HC subjects. Despite uniformly pauci-clonal antibody repertoires some patients with PAD generated potent serological responses, highlighting a possible limitation of traditional serological techniques. These findings suggest that IgG repertoire restriction is a key feature of antibody repertoires in PAD.",10.1016/j.jaci.2023.02.033,36965845,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 13:17:32.193969-04:00,No,,
17088,S2k guidelines on the management of paraneoplastic pemphigus/paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome initiated by the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV).,,,,,,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,25,03,2023,"Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP), also called paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome (PAMS), is a rare autoimmune disease with mucocutaneous and multi-organ involvement. PNP/PAMS is typically associated with lymphoproliferative or haematological malignancies, and less frequently with solid malignancies. The mortality rate of PNP/PAMS is elevated owing to the increased risk of severe infections and disease-associated complications, such as bronchiolitis obliterans. These guidelines summarize evidence-based and expert-based recommendations (S2k level) for the clinical characterization, diagnosis and management of PNP/PAMS. They have been initiated by the Task Force Autoimmune Blistering Diseases of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology with the contribution of physicians from all relevant disciplines. The degree of consent among all task force members was included. Chronic severe mucositis and polymorphic skin lesions are clue clinical characteristics of PNP/PAMS. A complete assessment of the patient with suspected PNP/PAMS, requiring histopathological study and immunopathological investigations, including direct and indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA and, where available, immunoblotting/immunoprecipitation, is recommended to achieve a diagnosis of PNP/PAMS. Detection of anti-envoplakin antibodies and/or circulating antibodies binding to the rat bladder epithelium at indirect immunofluorescence is the most specific tool for the diagnosis of PNP/PAMS in a patient with compatible clinical and anamnestic features. Treatment of PNP/PAMS is highly challenging. Systemic steroids up to 1.5&#xa0;mg/kg/day are recommended as first-line option. Rituximab is also recommended in patients with PNP/PAMS secondary to lymphoproliferative conditions but might also be considered in cases of PNP/PAMS associated with solid tumours. A multidisciplinary approach involving pneumologists, ophthalmologists and onco-haematologists is recommended for optimal management of the patients. These are the first European guidelines for the diagnosis and management of PNP/PAMS. Diagnostic criteria and therapeutic recommendations will require further validation by prospective studies.",10.1111/jdv.18931,36965110,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 00:23:14.756536-04:00,No,,

Therefore, we sought to investigate the antibody responses and maternal and fetal adverse events following this vaccine in pregnant mothers in Sri Lanka. SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) specific total antibodies and ACE2 blocking antibodies were measured by ELISA in pregnant mothers (n = 94) who received the vaccine in the first (n = 2), second (n = 57) and third (n = 33) trimester of pregnancy. Data regarding adverse events and fetal and maternal outcomes were obtained from the women once they delivered. No adverse maternal or fetal complications reported such as miscarriage, thrombotic events, hypertensive disorders, fetal death, preterm delivery, or congenital anomalies were reported. 58/94 (61.7%) had RBD binding antibodies and were found to be seropositive at the time of recruitment. All women seroconverted after the second dose and 31/36 previously uninfected women and 57/58 previously infected women gave a positive response to ACE2 blocking antibodies.

Female community health volunteers (FCHVs) have proven effective in the delivery of reproductive, maternal, and child health services in Nepal and recently in the prevention and management of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Evidence on their roles in COPD management is not yet available. The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a training program for FCHVs regarding COPD prevention and management. The training program was part of a cluster-randomized trial of a 12-month intervention to improve COPD outcomes in a semi-urban area of Western Nepal. A six-day workshop consisting of thirty hours of training was developed for FCHVs. Training materials incorporated introduction to COPD, risk factors and symptoms, COPD status assessment guide for FCHVs, guidance on breathing techniques, and exercises for people living with COPD. Pre- and post-test questionnaires were administered to assess the change in knowledge of FCHVs, post training skills assessment followed by semi-structured interviews assessed FCHVs' satisfaction with the training program. The findings of the pre- and post- test assessments showed a significant improvement in FCHVs' COPD-related knowledge from a median (interquartile range) score of 12 (3-16) before to 21 (21-22) (p&lt;0.001) after the training program. The qualitative assessment revealed the feasibility of FCHVs' training on COPD and their acceptability to deliver the intervention package within the community. It also indicated that implementing future training with an extended period and a few days break in-between could enhance the effectiveness. Training of FCHVs in COPD management is feasible and leads to improvement in knowledge.

Thirty female SD rats were randomly divided into control group, model group and EA group, with 10 rats in each group. IBS-D model was established by chronic unpredictable mild stress combined with senna solution gavage. Rats in the EA group received EA treatment (2 Hz/15 Hz&#xff0c;0.1-1.0 mA) at """"Zusanli"""" (ST36), """"Taichong""""(LR3) and """"Tianshu""""(ST25), 20 min per day, for a total of 14 days, with sides alternated daily.

To examine whether intraoperative spinal cord stimulation (SCS) inhibits the development of spine surgery-induced hypersensitivity. Managing postoperative pain after spine surgery is challenging, and as many as 40% of patients may develop failed back surgery syndrome. Although SCS has been shown to effectively reduce chronic pain symptoms, it is unknown whether intraoperative SCS can mitigate the development of central sensitization that causes postoperative pain hypersensitivity and potentially leads to failed back surgery syndrome after spine surgery. Mice were randomly stratified into three experimental groups: (1) sham surgery, (2) laminectomy alone, and (3) laminectomy plus SCS. Secondary mechanical hypersensitivity was measured in hind paws using von Frey assay one day before and at predetermined times after surgery. In addition, we also performed a conflict avoidance test to capture the affective-motivational domain of pain at selected time points postlaminectomy. Mice that underwent unilateral T13 laminectomy developed mechanical hypersensitivity in both hind paws. Intraoperative SCS applied to the exposed side of the dorsal spinal cord significantly inhibited the development of hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity on the SCS-applied side. Sham surgery did not produce any obvious secondary mechanical hypersensitivity in the hind paws.

At steady state, APCs thus control both tissue homeostasis and the induction of tolerance immune responses. In allergies however, APCs drive a Th2-biased immune response that is directed against otherwise harmless antigens from the environment. The main types of APCs involved in the induction of allergy are dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages. However, these cell types can be further divided into local, tissue-specific populations that differ in their phenotype, migratory capacity, T cell activating potential, and production of effector molecules. Understanding if distinct populations of APCs contribute to either tissue-specific immune tolerance, allergen sensitization, or allergic inflammation will allow us to better understand disease pathology and develop targeted treatment options for different stages of disease. Therefore, this review describes the main characteristics, phenotypes, and effector molecules of the APCs involved in the induction of allergen-specific Th2 responses in important barrier sites, such as the skin, nose, lung, and gastrointestinal tract.

Insufficient comprehension of these cancers has impeded the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Bioinformatics empowered us to investigate these cancers from new entry points. DNA methylation data of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) and anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) were analyzed to identify the significantly altered pathways. Through analyses integrated with RNA sequencing data of genes in these pathways, genes with strongest correlation to the TNM staging of CESC was identified and their correlations with overall survival in patients were assessed. To find a potential promising drug, correlation analysis of gene expression levels and compound sensitivity was performed. <i>In vitro</i> experiments were conducted to validate these findings. We further performed molecular docking experiments to explain our findings. Significantly altered pathways included immune, HPV infection, oxidative stress, ferroptosis and necroptosis. 10 hub genes in these pathways (PSMD11, RB1, SAE1, TAF15, TFDP1, CORO1C, JOSD1, CDC42, KPNA2 and NUP62) were identified, in which only CDC42 high expression was statistically significantly correlated with overall survival (Hazard Ratio: 1.6, <i>P</i> = 0.045). Afatinib was then screened out to be tested. <i>In vitro</i> experiments exhibited that the expression level of CDC42 was upregulated in HaCaT/A431 cells transfected with HPV E6 and E7, and the inhibitory effect of afatinib on proliferation was enhanced after transfection. CDC42-GTPase-effector interface-EGFR-afatinib was found to be a stable complex with a highest ZDOCK score of 1264.017. We identified CDC42 as a pivotal gene in the pathophysiology of HPV-related cancers. The upregulation of CDC42 could be a signal for afatinib treatment and the mechanism in which may be an increased affinity of EGFR to afatinib, inferred from a high stability in the quaternary complex of CDC42-GTPase-effector interface-EGFR-afatinib.",10.3389/fimmu.2023.1118458,36936942,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-12 01:05:39.102836-04:00,No,,

Under steady-state conditions, the two E3 ligases MDM2/MDM4 interact with and inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53. Inhibition of p53-MDM2/4 interaction to reactivate p53 in tumors with wild-type (WT) p53 has therefore been considered a therapeutic strategy. Moreover, studies indicate that p53 reactivation may synergize with radiation and increase tumor immunogenicity. <i>In vivo</i> studies of most MDM2 inhibitors have utilized immunodeficient xenograft mouse models, preventing detailed studies of action of these molecules on the immune response.

In this study, we tested a p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction inhibitor, the small molecule Navtemadlin, which is currently being tested in phase II clinical trials. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics and imaging flow cytometry, we identified specific protein expression patterns following Navtemadlin treatment of B16-F10 melanoma cells compared with their p53 CRISPR-inactivated control cells. <i>In vitro</i>, Navtemadlin induced a significant, p53-dependent, growth arrest but little apoptosis in B16-F10 cells.

These cellular lesions were more diverse in composition than necrotizing lesions and could be stratified into four general classes based on cellular composition and spatial distribution of B cells and macrophages. The cellular composition of non-necrotizing structures also correlates with their proximity to necrotizing lesions, indicating these are foci of distinct immune reactions adjacent to necrotizing granulomas.

We performed a random-effects pairwise meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials addressing antialarmin therapy in severe asthma. Results use relative risk (RR) values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we report mean difference (MD) values and 95% CIs. We define high eosinophils as &#x2265;300 cells/&#x3bc;L and low eosinophils as &lt;300 cells/&#x3bc;L. We used Cochrane-endorsed RoB 2.0 software to assess the risk of bias of trials, and we used the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (aka GRADE) framework to assess the certainty of the evidence. We identified 12 randomized trials including 2391 patients. Antialarmins probably reduce annualized exacerbation rates in patients with high eosinophils (RR 0.33 [95% CI 0.28 to 0.38]; moderate certainty). Antialarmins may reduce this rate in patients with low eosinophils (RR 0.59 [95% CI 0.38 to 0.90]; low certainty). Antialarmins improve FEV<sub>1</sub> in patients with high eosinophils (MD 218.5 mL [95% CI 160.2 to 276.7]; high certainty). Antialarmin therapy probably does not improve FEV<sub>1</sub> in patients with low eosinophils (MD 68.8 mL [95% CI 22.4 to 115.2]; moderate certainty). Antialarmins reduce blood eosinophils, total IgE, and fractional excretion of nitric oxide across studied subjects.

The diagnostic can be made by histological identification of non-caseous granuloma or by a combination of clinical criteria. Active inflammatory granuloma can lead to fibrotic damage. Although 50% of cases resolve spontaneously, systemic treatments are often necessary to decrease symptoms and avoid permanent organ dysfunction, notably in cardiac sarcoidosis. The course of the disease can be punctuated by exacerbations and relapses and the prognostic depends mainly on affected sites and patient management. FDG-PET/CT along with newer FDG-PET/MR have emerged as key imaging modalities in sarcoidosis, namely for certain diagnostic purposes, staging and biopsy guiding. By identifying with a high sensitivity inflammatory active granuloma, FDG hybrid imaging is a main prognostic tool and therapeutic ally in sarcoidosis.

Cross-sectional data from the 2011-2020 National Immunization Survey-Teen were used to assess trends in provider-verified HPV vaccination initiation (&#x2265;1 dose) among 13-17-year-olds, parental intent to initiate vaccination, and primary reasons for parental hesitancy. Among all sex and race and ethnicity groups, prevalence of HPV vaccination initiation increased over time, but parental intent to vaccinate against HPV for unvaccinated teens remained consistently low (&#x2264;45%). Among hesitant parents, 'safety concerns' increased in nearly all demographic groups with the greatest increases observed for non-Hispanic White female and male teens; no change was observed for non-Hispanic Black female teens. In 2019-2020, parents of unvaccinated non-Hispanic White teens were least likely to intend on vaccinating against HPV, and the most common hesitancy reason varied by sex and race and ethnicity (e.g., 'safety concerns' for White teens and 'not necessary' for Black female teens). Although HPV vaccination initiation increased over time, a substantial fraction of parents remain hesitant and trends in the reason for hesitancy varied by sex and race and ethnicity. Health campaigns and clinicians should address vaccine safety and necessity. Adolescent vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is a critical tool for cancer prevention.

HIV,Lancet HIV,08,05,2023,"Epidemiological monitoring of HIV among transgender women is minimal despite prioritisation of this group in the US National HIV/AIDS Strategy (2022-2025). We aimed to estimate HIV incidence in a multisite cohort of transgender women in the eastern and southern USA. Participant deaths were identified during follow-up; thus, we felt it was an ethical imperative to report mortality alongside HIV incidence. In this study, we established a multisite cohort across two modes: a site-based, technology-enhanced mode in six cities (Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City, and Washington, DC) and an exclusively digital mode that spanned 72 eastern and southern US cities that matched the six site-based cities based on population size and demographics. Trans feminine adults (&#x2265;18 years) who were not living with HIV were eligible and followed up for at least 24 months. Participants completed surveys and oral fluid HIV testing with clinical confirmation. We ascertained deaths through community and clinical sources. We estimated HIV incidence and mortality using the number of HIV seroconversions and deaths, respectively, divided by person-years accumulated from enrolment. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of HIV seroconversion (primary outcome) or death. Between March 22, 2018, and Aug 31, 2020, we enrolled 1312 participants with 734 (56%) in site-based and 578 (44%) in digital modes. At the 24-month assessment, 633 (59%) of 1076 eligible participants consented to extending participation. 1084 (83%) of 1312 participants were retained at this analysis based on the study definition of loss to follow-up. As of May 25, 2022, the cohort participants had contributed 2730 accumulated person-years to the analytical dataset. Overall HIV incidence was 5&#xb7;5 (95% CI 2&#xb7;7-8&#xb7;3) per 1000 person-years and incidence was higher among Black participants and those living in the south. Nine participants died during the study. The overall mortality rate was 3&#xb7;3 (95% CI 1&#xb7;5-6&#xb7;3) per 1000 person-years, and the rate was higher among Latinx participants. Identical predictors of HIV seroconversion and death included residence in southern cities, sexual partnerships with cisgender men, and use of stimulants. Participation in the digital cohort and seeking care for gender transition were inversely associated with both outcomes. As HIV research and interventions are increasingly delivered online, differences by mode highlight the need for continued community and location-based efforts to reach the most marginalised transgender women. Our findings underscore community calls for interventions that address social and structural contexts that affect survival and other health concerns alongside HIV prevention.

Inhibition of HDC activity to decrease histamine production is one way to alleviate allergic symptoms. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) with reported anti-allergy effect is one of important source to search for natural HDC inhibitor. Ultrafiltration combined with high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UF-HPLC/MS) is an effective method for screening HDC inhibitor from TCMs. Nevertheless, false-positive and false-negative results caused by the non-specific binding and the neglection of the trace active compounds are major problems in this method. In this study, an integrated strategy that combined UF-HPLC/MS with enzyme channel blocking (ECB) technique and directional enrichment (DE) technique was developed to seek natural HDC inhibitors from Radix Paeoniae alba (RPA), and at the same time, to reduce false-positive and false-negative results. HDC activity was detected to determine the validity of the screened compounds by RP-HPLC-FD in vitro. Molecular docking was applied to assay the binding affinity and binding sites. As a result, three compounds were screened from low content components of RPA after the DE. Among them, two non-specific compounds were eliminated by ECB, and the specific compound was identified as catechin, which has obvious HDC inhibition activity with IC<sub>50</sub> 0.52&#xa0;mM. Furthermore, gallic acid (IC<sub>50</sub> 1.8&#xa0;mM) and paeoniflorin (IC<sub>50</sub>&gt;2&#xa0;mM) from high content components of RPA were determined having HDC inhibitory activity.

Searched PubMed database, reviewed AR and CRSwNP-related literature, and discussed disease diagnosis, comorbidity, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. Similarities and differences in B-cell biology and IgE are compared in the 2 conditions. Both AR and CRSwNP have evidence for pathological type 2 inflammation, B-cell activation and differentiation, and IgE production. However, distinctions exist in the clinical and serological profiles at diagnosis, as well as treatments utilized. B-cell activation in AR may more frequently be regulated in the germinal center of lymphoid follicles, whereas CRSwNP may occur via extrafollicular pathways although controversies remain in these initial activating events. Oligoclonal and antigen-specific IgE maybe predominate in AR, but polyclonal and antigen-nonspecific IgE may predominate in CRSwNP.

The COVID-19 pandemic worsened these health outcome disparities and healthcare access disparities, especially with the abrupt transition to online care. This study classified electronic health literacy (EHL) among patients at an urban, academic hospital in the Bronx, and assessed for associations between EHL levels and various demographic characteristics. We designed a cross-sectional, observational study in adults 18 years or older presenting to the Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care (MECCC) Department of Radiation Oncology or the Montefiore Department of Medicine in the Bronx. We assessed EHL using the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) survey, a previously validated tool, and our newly developed eHealth Literacy Objective Scale-Scenario Based (eHeLiOS-SB) tool. A total of 97 patients recruited from the Montefiore MECCC and Department of Medicine participated in this study. There was a statistically significant association between age and EHL as assessed by both eHEALS and eHeLiOS-SB, with older adults having lower EHL scores. Additionally, a question designed to assess general attitudes toward digital health technologies found that most participants had a positive attitude toward such applications. Many patients, especially older adults, may require additional support to effectively navigate telehealth.

Baicalin has great anti-inflammatory, proliferation-inhibited, and respiratory disease-relieving properties. However, the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of baicalin on ASMC-mediated airway remodeling in mice are still poorly understood. After establishing the asthmatic mice model by ovalbumin (OVA) and interfering with baicalin, airway remodeling characteristics such as airway resistance, mRNA, and protein expression levels of remodeling-related cytokines were measured by histopathological assessment, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and western blot. Further efforts on detailed mechanisms were used antibody arrays to compare the expression and activation of proteins involved in the RAS signaling pathway. In addition, validation experiments were performed in ASMC proliferation model and low-expression cells of the target gene by using shRNA. In OVA-induced asthmatic mice model, baicalin significantly reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells in lung tissue, attenuated airway resistance, and decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of remodeling-related cytokines such as interleukin-13 (IL-13), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-<i>&#x3b2;</i>1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1). The results of antibody arrays involved in RAS signaling pathway revealed that OVA and baicalin administration altered the activation of protein kinase C alpha type (PKC-<i>&#x3b1;</i>), A-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (A-RAF), mitogen-activated protein kinase 2 (MEK2), extracellular regulated MAP kinase (ERK), MAPK interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (MNK1), and ETS transcription factor 1 (ELK1). The above results were further verified in the ASMC proliferation model. A-RAF silencing (shA-RAF) could promote ASMC proliferation and downregulate p-MEK2, p-ERK, p-MNK1, and p-ELK1 expression. The effects of baicalin against airway remodeling and ASMC proliferation might partially be achieved by suppressing the RAS signaling pathway.

Findings from 33 studies were synthesized with an emphasis on the effect of mood state of the sample and affective salience of the task. Results suggest trait-like brain activation abnormalities in regions implicated in impulsivity that persist across mood states. During rapid-response inhibition, BD exhibit under-activation of key frontal, insular, parietal, cingulate, and thalamic regions, but over-activation of these regions when the task involves emotional stimuli. Delay discounting tasks with functional neuroimaging in BD are lacking, but hyperactivity of orbitofrontal and striatal regions associated with reward hypersensitivity may be related to difficulty delaying gratification.

The high availability of smart phones provides the opportunity to furnish patient training via specifically designed chatbot applications. The goal of this protocol is to perform a first pilot comparison of traditional face to face versus chatbot-guided patient therapeutic education programmes for patients with asthma. Eighty adult patients with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of asthma will be enrolled in a two-parallel-arm, randomised (1:1) controlled pilot trial. A single-Zelen consent procedure is deployed to first enrol all participants in the comparator arm, that is, the standard patient therapeutic education programme at the University Hospitals of Montpellier, France. This means of patient therapeutic education is based on reoccurring interviews and discussion with qualified nursing staff as per usual care. Following baseline data acquisition, randomisation will be performed. Those patients randomised to the comparator arm will not be informed of the second arm. Those patients randomised to the experimental arm will be proposed access to a specifically designed chatbot (Vik-Asthme) as the second tested means of patient training (refusals continue with standard training, though analysed as intention to treat).

In the Universal arm, all participants received PrEP counselling and self-selected whether to initiate PrEP. In the Targeted arm, participants underwent an HIV risk assessment, including an objective risk-scoring tool and an offer of HIV self-tests for at-home partner testing; those determined to be at high risk received a PrEP offer. Participants were followed through 9 months postpartum. Primary outcomes included incident HIV and appropriate PrEP use (defined as PrEP uptake among those at high risk and no PrEP uptake for those not at risk). Outcomes were compared using intention-to-treat analyses, adjusting for baseline HIV risk and marital status. Among 4447 women enrolled, the median age was 24.0 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 20.9, 28.3), and most were married (84.8%). The median gestational age at enrolment was 24 weeks (IQR: 20, 30).

Our aim was to identify synthetic antimicrobials termed conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) that effectively treated AMR infections and whose structures could be readily modified to address current and anticipated patient needs. Fifteen chemical variants were synthesized that contain specific alterations to the COE modular structure, and each variant was evaluated for broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and for in&#xa0;vitro cytotoxicity in cultured mammalian cells. Antibiotic efficacy was analyzed in murine models of sepsis; in&#xa0;vivo toxicity was evaluated via a blinded study of mouse clinical signs as an outcome of drug treatment. We identified a compound, COE2-2hexyl, that displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. This compound cured mice infected with clinical bacterial isolates derived from patients with refractory bacteremia and did not evoke bacterial resistance. COE2-2hexyl has specific effects on multiple membrane-associated functions (e.g., septation, motility, ATP synthesis, respiration, membrane permeability to small molecules) that may act together to negate bacterial cell viability and the evolution of drug-resistance. Disruption of these bacterial properties may occur through alteration of critical protein-protein or protein-lipid membrane interfaces-a mechanism of action distinct from many membrane disrupting antimicrobials or detergents that destabilize membranes to induce bacterial cell lysis. The ease of molecular design, synthesis and modular nature of COEs offer many advantages over conventional antimicrobials, making synthesis simple, scalable and affordable.

Persistent pain can be viewed as a consequence of maladaptive plasticity which, like most enduring forms of cellular plasticity, requires altered expression of specific gene programs. Control of gene expression at the level of protein synthesis is broadly utilized to directly modulate changes in activity and responsiveness in nociceptive pathways and provides an effective mechanism for compartmentalized regulation of the proteome in peripheral nerves through local translation. Levels of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are commonly impacted by peripheral nerve injury leading to persistent pain. NcRNAs exert spatiotemporal regulation of local proteomes and affect signaling cascades supporting altered sensory responses that contribute to hyperalgesia. This review discusses ncRNAs found in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that are dysregulated following nerve injury and the current understanding of their roles in pathophysiological pain-related responses including neuroimmune interactions, neuronal survival and axon regeneration, Schwann cell dedifferentiation and proliferation, intercellular communication, and the generation of ectopic action potentials in primary afferents.

Because of the concern for severe infection in those with immunocompromise, patients have been eager for effective prevention, vaccination, and treatment strategies. Preexposure prophylaxis provides another means of prevention in those with immunocompromise. A&#xa0;combination of tixagevimab and cilgavimab (Evusheld [AstraZeneca Cambridge, United Kingdom]) was granted emergency use authorization for preexposure prophylaxis at the end of 2021, but questions remained regarding how this would be tolerated and the side effects associated with its use. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Evusheld in patients with CVID from our tri-site institution. We performed an institutional review board-approved, retrospective chart review of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) who received Evusheld before March 26, 2022. Of the 45 patients with CVID who received Evusheld, 41 (91%) received the recommended full dose of 600 mg. The majority of patients (39 of 45 [87%]) tolerated Evusheld without adverse events. The adverse events reported included immediate injection site pain, fatigue and cough, an episode of shingles, and chest pain. This is an initial report on the safety and tolerability of Evusheld injections in patients with CVID. The majority of patients tolerated the injections without adverse events. For patients with reported chest pain, the results of a subsequent cardiac workup were negative.

From October 2017 to February 2019, patients undergoing elective shoulder arthroplasty or arthroscopic shoulder surgery at a major academic medical center were offered enrollment; they signed an informed consent to participate. Patients under the age of 18, scheduled for revision shoulder arthroplasty, or with sensitivity or allergy to silver, zinc, or latex were excluded. Subjects underwent skin culture swab of the shoulder in the mid-point of the planned deltopectoral incision. The JumpStart (Arthrex; Naples, FL) microcurrent dressing was then placed over the area of the planned incision, and a full-thickness skin biopsy was harvested from the incision at the initiation of the surgical procedure. All specimens were cultured for <i>C. acnes</i> by the hospital's clinical microbiology laboratory with standard anaerobic technique. <i>Results</i>: Thirty-one subjects were enrolled in the study. Those who demonstrated no growth at baseline for the control specimen were excluded from further analysis (N = 11), given the absence of preoperative <i>C. acnes</i> colonization. Culture results from the 20 remaining subjects revealed significantly diminished <i>C. acnes</i> skin growth at the time of surgery compared to baseline. Sixty percent (12 of 20) of the subjects with positive skin swabs at baseline demonstrated no growth in the skin biopsy specimens at the time of surgery. There were no adverse events associated with the application of the microcurrent dressing. <i>Conclusion</i>: This prospective case series found that preoperative application of a microcurrent dressing resulted in significantly diminished <i>C. acnes</i> skin burden at the time of surgery in patients undergoing elective shoulder arthroplasty or arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

It is currently well-established that food tolerance requires the strict maintenance of a specific microbial consortium in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiome as alterations in the gut microbiota can lead to dysbiosis, causing inflammation and pathogenic intestinal conditions that result in the development of FA. Although there is currently not enough knowledge to fully understand how the interactions between gut microbiota, host responses and the environment cause food allergies, recent advances in '-omics' technologies (i.e., proteomics, genomics, metabolomics) and in approaches involving systems biology suggest future headways that would finally allow the scientific understanding of the relationship between gut microbiome and FA.

Meanwhile, there is little data available on the respiratory effects of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Hence, we examined the association between SGLT2i use and the risk of adverse respiratory events in a real-world setting. We conducted a population-based, nationwide cohort study using an active-comparator new-user design and nationwide claims data of South Korea from January 2015 to December 2020. Among individuals aged 18&#xa0;years or older, propensity score matching was done to match each new user of SGLT2is with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4is), with patients followed up according to an as-treated definition. The primary outcome was respiratory events, a composite endpoint of acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome and in-hospital death. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Of 205,534 patient pairs in the propensity score matched cohort, the mean age of the entire cohort was 53.8&#xa0;years and 59% were men, with a median follow-up of 0.66&#xa0;years; all baseline covariates achieved balance between the two groups. Incidence rates for overall respiratory events were 4.54 and 7.54 per 1000 person-years among SGLT2i and DPP4i users, respectively, corresponding to a rate difference of 3 less events per 1000 person-years (95% CI&#x2009;-&#x2009;3.44 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;2.55). HRs (95% CIs) were 0.60 (0.55 to 0.64) for the composite respiratory endpoint, 0.35 (0.23 to 0.55) for acute pulmonary edema, 0.44 (0.18 to 1.05) for ARDS, 0.61 (0.56 to 0.66) for pneumonia, 0.49 (0.31 to 0.76) for respiratory failure, and 0.46 (0.41 to 0.51) for in-hospital death. Similar trends were found across individual SGLT2is, subgroup analyses of age, sex, history of comorbidities, and a range of sensitivity analyses. These findings suggest a lower risk of adverse respiratory events associated with patients with T2D initiating SGLT2is versus DPP4is.

Co-morbidities such as asthma and allergic rhinitis as well as the psychological impact influence seriously the quality of life of the patients. Recent studies have shown that only 10% of atopic patients undergo full manifestation of the atopic march, while 40% demonstrate concomitant food allergy. Exposure to food allergens in the environment causes sensitization and food allergy through the disruption of the skin barrier, as in AD. Food allergy and AD are closely related. While not all AD patients have a food allergy, 20-40% of children with moderate to severe AD will have an IgE-mediated food allergy. It is known that they may coexist but it is unclear if food allergy worsens the course of AD. Experimental, clinical, and epidemiological studies have provided evidence of the primary role of an epidermal barrier defect in the development of sensitization to environmental allergens and that this process occurs in the damaged skin barrier rather than the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract.

Unfortunately, some engrafted organs are lost to polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PyVAN) caused by BK and JC viruses (BKPyV and JCPyV). Both viruses cause brain disease and possibly bladder cancer in immunosuppressed individuals. Transplant patients are routinely monitored for BKPyV viremia, which is an accepted hallmark of nascent nephropathy. If viremia is detected, a reduction in immunosuppressive therapy is standard care, but the intervention comes with increased risk of immune rejection of the engrafted organ. Recent reports have suggested that transplant recipients with high levels of polyomavirus-neutralizing antibodies are protected against PyVAN. Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines, similar to approved human papillomavirus vaccines, have an excellent safety record and are known to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies and long-lasting protection from infection. In this study, we demonstrate that VLPs representing BKPyV genotypes I, II, and IV, as well as JCPyV genotype 2 produced in insect cells elicit robust antibody titers. In rhesus macaques, all monkeys developed neutralizing antibody titers above a previously proposed protective threshold of 10,000. A second inoculation, administered 19&#xa0;weeks after priming, boosted titers to a plateau of &#x2265; 25,000 that was maintained for almost two years. No vaccine-related adverse events were observed in any macaques. A multivalent BK/JC VLP immunogen did not show inferiority compared to the single-genotype VLP immunogens.

In addition to late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), native T1 and T2 mapping as well as extracellular volume (ECV) are essential tools for tissue characterization. However, the differentiation of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) from myocarditis of other etiology can be challenging. Positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) regularly shows the highest Fluordesoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in LGE positive regions. It was therefore the aim of this study to investigate, whether native T1, T2, and ECV measurements within LGE regions can improve the differentiation of CS and myocarditis compared with using global native T1, T2, and ECV values alone. PET/CT confirmed CS patients and myocarditis patients (both acute and chronic) from a prospective registry were compared with respect to regional native T1, T2, and ECV. Acute and chronic myocarditis were defined based on the 2013 European Society of Cardiology position paper on myocarditis. All parametric measures and ECV were acquired in standard fashion on three short-axis slices according to the ConSept study for global values and within PET-CT positive regions of LGE. Between 2017 and 2020, 33 patients with CS and 73 chronic and 35 acute myocarditis patients were identified. The mean ECV (&#xb1;&#x2009;SD) in LGE regions of CS patients was higher than in myocarditis patients (CS vs. acute and chronic, respectively: 0.65&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.12 vs. 0.45&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.13 and 0.47&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.1; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

A complex systems perspective allows for both detailed resolution of these evolutionary relationships as well as comparison and synthesis across systems. Using proxy data of insect herbivore damage (denoted by the damage type or DT) preserved on fossil leaves, functional bipartite network representations provide insights into how plant-insect associations depend on geological time, paleogeographical space, and environmental variables such as temperature and precipitation. However, the metrics measured from such networks are prone to sampling bias. Such sensitivity is of special concern for plant-DT association networks in paleontological settings where sampling effort is often severely limited. Here, we explore the sensitivity of functional bipartite network metrics to sampling intensity and identify sampling thresholds above which metrics appear robust to sampling effort. Across a broad range of sampling efforts, we find network metrics to be less affected by sampling bias and/or sample size than richness metrics, which are routinely used in studies of fossil plant-DT interactions. These results provide reassurance that cross-comparisons of plant-DT networks offer insights into network structure and function and support their widespread use in paleoecology.

Although fens may persist naturally, ongoing environmental changes increase productivity and accelerate succession. These processes can be mitigated through conservation management with appropriate settings. However, long-term management experiments are challenging and provide only locally valid results. Here, we analysed vegetation data (bryophytes and vascular plants) from seven management experiments (spanning 3-20 years) conducted in Central European poor, moderately-rich, and calcareous spring fens (Czech Republic, Slovakia). Two of these experiments examined the effects of restoration of abandoned fens, while five experiments examined changes in mowing regimes in managed fens (cessation, intensification, delay to autumn, and litter removal). Data were analysed using unidimensional and multidimensional methods separately for the initial, extended, and entire period. Mowing had a statistically significant effect on species composition except for the shortest (3-year) experiment. Litter removal did not compensate for mowing. Mowing twice or delayed mowing significantly affected the species composition of calcareous fens. In all cases, cessation of mowing significantly reduced the richness of species, especially those of conservation importance. In contrast, any mowing of abandoned fens increased species richness. The effects of mowing intensification or cessation on species richness and composition of a restored calcareous fen were evident in the first 2-3 years. Other effects were initially weak or nonsignificant but later became stronger, such as mowing delay and restoration removal of litter, which became significant only after nearly 20 years. We found that cessation or restoration of mowing usually triggers a rapid vegetation change, whereas it can take decades to detect the response caused by changes in mowing timing. Importantly, mowing can stabilise or even restore vegetation of fen ecosystems that have been weakened by their fragmentation in the temperate agricultural landscapes.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157293,35835198,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:56:58.259699-04:00,No,,

Small-scale Sphagnum removal is a rarely implemented conservational measure, whose success may depend on soil alkalinity and fertility (i.e., nutrient availability). Therefore, characterizing the effects of pH and fertility levels would potentially allow for the development of better Sphagnum removal strategies. Two experiments were conducted across 24 rich fens of different alkalinity and fertility located in an area of ~32,000&#x2009;km<sup>2</sup> spanning from the Bohemian Massif to the Western Carpathians (Europe). We hypothesized that high alkalinity and low fertility support the restoration of rich fen vegetation after Sphagnum removal. Our study focused on four different Sphagnum groups. In Experiment 1, the treatment plots remained unfenced. In Experiment 2, the treatment plots were fenced off and target brown mosses were transplanted from the surroundings to overcome dispersal limitations. A repeated-measures design was used, with vegetation composition recorded over a 5-year period. High alkalinity rather than fertility facilitated species richness and the appearance of target brown mosses. High alkalinity generally hindered Sphagnum recovery, whereas high fertility supported the recurrence of S. teres and S. recurvum agg. Under high pH conditions, enhanced fertility further correlated with the spread of nonsphagnaceous generalist bryophytes of low conservation value. Despite sustaining a significant overall reduction, all Sphagnum taxa began to recover throughout the experiment, albeit less obviously in fens with S. warnstorfii. Sphagnum removal may reverse biodiversity loss and allow for the restoration of brown mosses in rich fens where Sphagnum cover had increased due to slight eutrophication, acidification, or a decrease in the water table. In alkaline and nutrient-poor conditions (e.g., S. warnstorfii fens), the effect is evident and long lasting and the intervention may not be extensive. In fens dominated by S. teres or S. recurvum agg., repeated or large-scale removal may be needed if high nutrient availability (potassium, phosphorus) or low alkalinity supports Sphagnum recolonization. Treatment plots with S. subgenus Sphagnum exhibited the least promising brown-moss restoration prospects.",10.1002/eap.2691,35697659,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 12:13:10.512236-04:00,No,,

Large-scale devastation of forested environments resulting from the Chicxulub asteroid impact likely influenced the evolutionary trajectories of multiple clades in terrestrial environments, and it has been hypothesized to have biased survivorship in favour of nonarboreal lineages across the K-Pg boundary. Here, we evaluate patterns of substrate preferences across the K-Pg boundary among crown group mammals, a group that underwent rapid diversification following the mass extinction. Using Bayesian, likelihood, and parsimony reconstructions, we identify patterns of mammalian ecological selectivity that are broadly similar to those previously hypothesized for birds. Models based on extant taxa indicate predominant K-Pg survivorship among semi- or nonarboreal taxa, followed by numerous independent transitions to arboreality in the early Cenozoic. However, contrary to the predominant signal, some or all members of total-clade Euarchonta (Primates&#xa0;+&#xa0;Dermoptera&#xa0;+&#xa0;Scandentia) appear to have maintained arboreal habits across the K-Pg boundary, suggesting ecological flexibility during an interval of global habitat instability. We further observe a pronounced shift in character state transitions away from plesiomorphic arboreality associated with the K-Pg transition. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that predominantly nonarboreal taxa preferentially survived the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, and emphasize the pivotal influence of the K-Pg transition in shaping the early evolutionary trajectories of extant terrestrial vertebrates.",10.1002/ece3.8114,34765124,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 12:11:25.264822-04:00,No,,

This assumption has only been tested in limited geographical scales. In fens, one of the most endangered ecosystems in Europe, broader pH niches have been reported from cold areas and are expected for colder past periods. We used the largest European-scale vegetation database from fens to test the hypothesis that pH interacts with macroclimate temperature in forming realized niches of fen moss and vascular plant species. We calibrated the data set (29,885 plots after heterogeneity-constrained resampling) with temperature, using two macroclimate variables, and with the adjusted pH, a variable combining pH and calcium richness. We modelled temperature, pH and water level niches for one hundred species best characterizing European fens using generalized additive models and tested the interaction between pH and temperature. Fifty-five fen species showed a statistically significant interaction between pH and temperature (adj p&#xa0;&#x2c2;&#xa0;.01). Forty-six of them (84%) showed a positive interaction manifested by a shift or restriction of their niche to higher pH in warmer locations. Nine vascular plants and no moss showed the opposite interaction. Mosses showed significantly greater interaction. We conclude that climate significantly modulates edaphic niches of fen plants, especially bryophytes. This result explains previously reported regional changes in realized pH niches, a current habitat-dependent decline of endangered taxa, and distribution changes in the past. A warmer climate makes growing seasons longer and warmer, increases productivity, and may lower the water level. These effects prolong the duration and intensity of interspecific competition, support highly competitive Sphagnum mosses, and, as such, force niches of specialized fen species towards narrower high-pH ranges. Recent anthropogenic landscape changes pose a severe threat to many fen species and call for mitigation measures to lower competition pressure in their refugia.",10.1111/gcb.15980,34748262,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:45:11.594115-04:00,No,,

This strategy contrasts sharply with spring lambing further north, and provides benefits in terms of out-of-season availability of animal products. These competences are closely linked to specific sheep physiology and favorable Western Mediterranean climatic conditions. It is not known exactly how far back in the past the ability to de-season Mediterranean sheep breeds extends. This study shows that this practice existed seven millennia ago in Southern France, at an early stage of the major agricultural expansion of the Neolithic into the Western Mediterranean. To achieve this reproductive management regime, three prerequisites were required: (i) the ability of sheep to give birth in autumn, constituting early evidence for the genetic selection of specimens with prolonged reproductive fertility; (ii) intentional management of female and male interactions within the herd, which would have required good knowledge of the timing of the fertility cycle in ewes, and; (iii) adequate pasture resources to support lactation in the autumn, possibly favored by autumnal rains, substantiating previous paleoclimatological data for the existence of a Mediterranean-type precipitation regime at that time. Moreover, we also show that winter foddering of sheep occurred, using forest resources, and that this maintained good body weights for spring mating.

Efforts to compare biotic crises of the past and present, however, encounter difficulty because taxonomic and ecological changes are decoupled, and although various metrics exist for describing taxonomic turnover, no methods have yet been proposed to quantify the ecological impacts of extinction events. To address this issue, we apply a network-based approach to exploring the evolution of marine animal communities over the Phanerozoic Eon. Network analysis of fossil co-occurrence data enables us to identify nonrandom associations of interrelated paleocommunities. These associations, or evolutionary paleocommunities, dominated total diversity during successive intervals of relative community stasis. Community turnover occurred largely during mass extinctions and radiations, when ecological reorganization resulted in the decline of one association and the rise of another. Altogether, we identify five evolutionary paleocommunities at the generic and familial levels in addition to three ordinal associations that correspond to Sepkoski's Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modern evolutionary faunas. In this context, we quantify magnitudes of ecological change by measuring shifts in the representation of evolutionary paleocommunities over geologic time. Our work shows that the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event had the largest effect on ecology, followed in descending order by the Permian-Triassic, Cretaceous-Paleogene, Devonian, and Triassic-Jurassic mass extinctions. Despite its taxonomic severity, the Ordovician extinction did not strongly affect co-occurrences of taxa, affirming its limited ecological impact.

However, the growing re-evaluation of some assemblages is revealing that bladelets are frequently obtained from independent reduction sequences, hence discouraging the direct application of the model developed in southwestern France. High-resolution regional signatures are thus needed to reconstruct a more accurate portrait of the AMH colonization dynamic. Northeastern Italy, with the key site of Fumane Cave, is one among the regions of Mediterranean Europe worthy of consideration for reconstructing this colonization process and its cultural dynamics. Within the framework of a critical discussion of the technological definition of the Protoaurignacian and its relationship with contemporaneous industries on a regional and supra-regional scale, we present the results of a detailed analysis of the lithic technology from units A2-A1 based on reduction sequence and attribute analyses. Results show that bladelets are the first goal of production and they do not originate from reduced blade cores but from a broad range of independent and simultaneous core reduction strategies. One implication is that the most commonly used technological trait that is said to define the Protoaurignacian has been over-emphasized and that the Protoaurignacian is technologically consistent across its geographical extent. Additional data based on carinated core technology imply that this techno-complex shares a common technological background with the Early Aurignacian and that no features are restricted to one of the two facies.

Unlike typical Jurassic bone deposits, it is dominated by the presence of <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i>. Since excavation began in the 1920s, numerous hypotheses have been put forward to explain the taphonomy of CLDQ, including a predator trap, a drought assemblage, and a poison spring. In an effort to reconcile the various interpretations of the quarry and reach a consensus on the depositional history of CLDQ, new data is required to develop a robust taphonomic framework congruent with all available data. Here we present two new data sets that aid in the development of such a robust taphonomic framework for CLDQ. First, x-ray fluorescence of CLDQ sediments indicate elevated barite and sulfide minerals relative to other sediments from the Morrison Formation in the region, suggesting an ephemeral environment dominated by periods of hypereutrophic conditions during bone accumulation. Second, the degree of abrasion and hydraulic equivalency of small bone fragments dispersed throughout the matrix were analyzed from CLDQ. Results of these analyses suggest that bone fragments are autochthonous or parautochthonous and are derived from bones deposited in the assemblage rather than transported. The variability in abrasion exhibited by the fragments is most parsimoniously explained by local periodic re-working and re-deposition during seasonal fluctuations throughout the duration of the quarry assemblage. Collectively, these data support previous interpretations that the CLDQ represents an attritional assemblage in a poorly-drained overbank deposit where vertebrate remains were introduced post-mortem to an ephemeral pond during flood conditions. Furthermore, while the elevated heavy metals detected at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry are not likely the primary driver for the accumulation of carcasses, they are likely the result of multiple sources; some metals may be derived from post-depositional and diagenetic processes, and others are potentially produced from an abundance of decomposing vertebrate carcasses.

We analyzed the stable carbon and oxygen isotope composition of paleosol carbonate and organic matter and fossil mammalian tooth enamel, including the first analyses for several extinct bovids such as Rusingoryx atopocranion, Damaliscus hypsodon, and an unnamed impala species. Both paleosol carbonate and organic matter data suggest that local habitats associated with human activities were primarily riverine woodland ecosystems. However, mammalian tooth enamel data indicate that most large-bodied mammals consumed a predominantly C4 diet, suggesting an extensive C4 grassland surrounding these riverine woodlands in the region at the time. These data are consistent with other lines of paleoenvironmental evidence that imply a substantially reduced Lake Victoria at this time, and demonstrate that C4 grasslands were significantly expanded into equatorial Africa compared with their present distribution, which could have facilitated dispersal of human populations and other biotic communities. Our results indicate that early populations of Homo sapiens from the Lake Victoria region exploited locally wooded and well-watered habitats within a larger grassland ecosystem.",10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.10.005,25805041,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:50:17.142171-04:00,No,,

Ecological specialization has been suggested as a major constraint impeding the response of species to environmental changes. Most neoecological studies indicate that specialists suffer declines under recent environmental changes. This was confirmed by many paleoecological studies investigating longer-term survival. However, phylogeneticists, studying the entire histories of lineages, showed that specialists are not trapped in evolutionary dead ends and could even give rise to generalists. Conclusions from these approaches diverge possibly because (i) of approach-specific biases, such as lack of standardization for sampling efforts (neoecology), lack of direct observations of specialization (paleoecology), or binary coding and prevalence of specialists (phylogenetics); (ii) neoecologists focus on habitat specialization; (iii) neoecologists focus on extinction of populations, phylogeneticists on persistence of entire clades through periods of varying extinction and speciation rates; (iv) many phylogeneticists study species in which specialization may result from a lack of constraints. We recommend integrating the three approaches by studying common datasets, and accounting for range-size variation among species, and we suggest novel hypotheses on why certain specialists may not be particularly at risk and consequently why certain generalists deserve no less attention from conservationists than specialists.",10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01336.x,19580588,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:51:37.023294-04:00,No,,

From April to June 2019, a survey was conducted along the East China Sea coast (Sansha and Lianjiang counties) to investigate the relationship between dissolved organic nutrients and P. donghaiense bloom. Our findings showed that dinoflagellates dominated the phytoplankton community, and dissolved organic nutrients were the major factors influencing community structure during the P. donghaiense bloom. Redundancy analysis indicated that P. donghaiense abundance was primarily affected by DON in the Sansha area while it was primarily affected by DON and DOP in the Lianjiang area. Correlation analysis also confirmed a strong positive correlation between dissolved organic nutrients and P. donghaiense abundance both in the Sansha and Lianjiang coastal areas (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001).

We found that diatoms displayed a potential water-depth pattern in species richness (alpha diversity) and community composition (beta diversity). However, for bacteria and protists, there was no significant relationship between water depth and species richness. This may be related to the biological characteristics of diatoms. The photosynthesis of diatoms and their distribution may be associated with the fluctuating light regime in the underwater climate. Moreover, salinity displayed negative effects on the abundance of some diatom and bacterial groups, which indicates that salinity may be one of the factors restricting ocean microorganism diversity.

Impacts were assessed on periphyton biomass, activities and tolerance to micropollutants, as well as on microbial diversity. Our results showed that wastewater microorganisms colonized periphyton and modified its community composition, resulting for instance in an increased abundance of Chloroflexi and a decreased abundance of diatoms and green algae. This led to shifts towards heterotrophy, as suggested by the changes in nutrient stoichiometry and the increased mineralization potential of carbon substrates. An increased tolerance towards micropollutants was only found for periphyton exposed to unfiltered wastewater but not to ultra-filtered wastewater, suggesting that wastewater microorganisms were responsible for this increased tolerance.

We addressed this problem by developing diatom multimetric indices (MMIs) of ecological condition using genus-level taxonomy and trait-based autecological information. The MMIs were designed to assess river and stream chemical, physical and biological condition across the conterminous United States. Trait-based approaches have the advantage of using both species-level and genus-level data, which require less effort and expense to acquire than traditional species-based approaches and eliminate the persistent taxonomic biases introduced over vast geographic extents. For large-extent assessment programs that require multiple taxonomic laboratories to process samples, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA's) National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA), the trait approach can eliminate discrepancies in species-level identification or nomenclature that hinder diatom data interpretation. We developed trait-based MMIs using NRSA data for each of the three large ecoregions across the U.S. - the East, Plains, and West. All three MMIs performed well in discriminating least-disturbed from most-disturbed sites. The MMI for the East had the greatest discrimination ability, followed by MMIs for the Plains and West, respectively. The performance of the MMIs was comparable to that observed in existing NRSA fish and macroinvertebrate MMIs. Our research shows that trait-based diatom indices constructed on genus-level taxonomy can be effective for large-scale assessments, and may also allow programs such as NRSA to assess trends in freshwater condition retrospectively, by revisiting older diatom datasets.

The light attenuating effect of coloured tDOM on phytoplankton growth has been a major focus of attention, but the phytotoxic effects of tDOM, particularly on cyanobacterial blooms, are less well understood. This mesocosm study tested whether coloured tDOM, leached from the leaves of a Eucalyptus tree species, inhibited a naturally occurring bloom of the toxic cyanobacterium, Raphidiopsis raciborskii, in a reservoir over a 10 day period. The study found that tDOM leachate, measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), inhibited photosynthesis and growth of both R.&#xa0;raciborskii, as well as species present at lower densities, i.e. other cyanobacteria and diatoms. However, the effect was greater at higher tDOM input loads.

By day 5, cell densities of cyanobacteria, including R.&#xa0;raciborskii, and diatoms, in treatments with 5.9 and 25 mg L<sup>-1</sup> DOC addition were significantly lower than the control with no tDOM addition, and this effect continued throughout the experiment. This is despite the leachate addition increasing phosphate concentrations which counteracted the low background concentrations of phosphate. Light attenuation and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels were also affected by the tDOM addition, but were only significantly lower in the 25 mg L<sup>-1</sup> DOC treatment compared with the control. DOC, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) concentrations all decreased in the tDOM addition treatments over the first 3 days, as the microbial cell densities increased. The components of the tDOM that decreased over time were determined by <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy in the 25 mg L<sup>-1</sup> DOC treatment. After 5 d, the relative concentrations of fatty acids, sugars and gallic acid decreased by around 60%, while concentrations of flavonoids and myo-inositol decreased by 45 and 35% respectively. This study suggests that phytotoxic compounds in tDOM can suppress cyanobacterial blooms, despite the increased nutrient inputs. This has implications for predicting the future likelihood of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes and reservoirs with climate-change driven changes in flow events, and other changes in the amount and types of vegetation cover.

The SEM analysis showed that NO<sub>3</sub>-N was retained as a statistically significant predictor for diatom biomass in P1-SA and significant effects of windspeed, zooplankton and NH<sub>4</sub>-N on diatom biomass in P2-WS. Windspeed and zooplankton have further changed the biomass of diatoms in the case of declining inorganic nitrogen. We conclude that the magnitude of vernal suppression or stimulation of diatom assemblages has increased, concomitant with the variations of NH<sub>4</sub>-N and NO<sub>3</sub>-N: NH<sub>4</sub>-N mass ratios. Diatoms response to NH<sub>4</sub>-N or NO<sub>3</sub>-N is apparently changing in response to water temperature in this eutrophic shallow lake. Thus, parallel reductions in external nitrogen loading, along with variations in dominant inorganic nitrogen, will stimulate the growth of diatom and therefore increase the total biomass of phytoplankton in still high internal phosphorus loading, which is should be regarded as a good sign of restoration measures.",10.1016/j.watres.2022.118493,35489153,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 00:49:26.673564-04:00,No,,

This integrative extraction system is well suited for the direct recovery of intracellular biocompounds from cells without the needs of discrete steps of mid- or down-stream bioprocessing. The potential of electropermeabilization-assisted LBF system in bioseparation was demonstrated in this study by using the diatom Chaetoceros calcitrans (C. calcitrans) as the source of fucoxanthin, which is a promising antioxidant highly demanded by food and pharmaceutical industries. The extraction performances of LBF and electropermeabilization-assisted LBF system were comprehensively evaluated under the optimal operating conditions. Comparatively, the optimized LBF and electropermeabilization-assisted LBF systems achieved the satisfactory yields of fucoxanthin, i.e., 14.78 mg/g and 16.09 mg/g, respectively. The good recovery of fucoxanthin using electropermeabilization-assisted LBF system could be attributed to the higher release of fucoxanthin from the electrotreated C. calcitrans, allowing a higher partition of fucoxanthin to the top phase of LBF system (236.72 as compared to 152.15 from LBF system). In addition, the fucoxanthin extracted suing both methods exhibit satisfactory antioxidant activities. The application of electropermeabilization-assisted LBF system in the extraction of fucoxanthin is a greener and highly efficient bioprocessing route which can be prospectively extended to other biocompound extraction from microalgal sources.",10.1016/j.chroma.2022.462915,35259646,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:53:28.893939-04:00,No,,

The dominance of diatoms generally shifts toward that of dinoflagellates in response to increasing temperature and reduced nutrient availability; however, contradictory findings have also been observed in certain sea areas. A key challenge in ecology and biogeochemistry is to quantitatively determine the effects of multiple environmental factors on the diatom-dinoflagellate community and the related changes in elemental and biochemical composition. Here, we test the interplay between temperature, nutrient concentrations and their ratios on marine diatom-dinoflagellate competition and chemical composition using bi-algal competition experiments. The ubiquitous diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> and dinoflagellate <i>Prorocentrum minimum</i> were cultivated semi-continuously, provided with different N and P concentrations (three different levels) and ratios (10:1, 24:1, and 63:1 molar ratios) under three temperatures (12, 18, and 24&#xb0;C). The responses of diatom-dinoflagellate competition were analyzed by a Lotka-Volterra model and quantified by generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs). The changes in nutrient concentrations significantly affected diatom-dinoflagellate competition, causing a competitive superiority of the diatoms at high nutrient concentrations, independent of temperature and N:P supply ratios. Interestingly, the effect amplitude of nutrient concentrations varied with different temperatures, showing a switch back toward a competitive superiority of the dinoflagellates at the highest temperature and at very high nutrient concentrations. The ratios of particulate organic nitrogen to phosphorus showed significant negative correlations with increasing diatoms/dinoflagellates ratios, while lipid biomarkers (fatty acids and sterols) correlated positively with increasing diatoms/dinoflagellates ratios over the entire ranges of temperature, N and P concentrations and N:P ratios.

We investigated the mechanisms regulating a massive winter diatom bloom in a temperate lake. High frequency data and process-based lake modeling demonstrated that phytoplankton growth in winter was dually controlled by light and temperature, rather than by light alone. Water temperature played a further indirect role in initiating the bloom through ice-thaw, which increased light exposure. The bloom was ultimately terminated by silicon limitation and sedimentation. These mechanisms differ from those typically responsible for spring diatom blooms and contributed to the high peak biomass.

Mineral deposits, even if unmined, can strongly influence stream water chemistry, stream biological communities and the ability of organisms to tolerate stressors. Using data sampled from six mining areas with three active (gold and chrome), two closed (gold) and one planned mine (phosphate), we examined how mineral deposits and mining influence water chemistry and diatom and macroinvertebrate communities in subarctic streams in Finnish Lapland. We supplemented the data by additional samples compiled from databases and further assessed how variation in background geological conditions influences bioassessments of the impacts arising from mining. We found that water specific conductivity was elevated in our study streams draining through catchments with a high mineral potential. Mining effects were mainly seen as increased concentration of nitrogen. Influence of mineral deposits was detected in composition of diatom and macroinvertebrate communities, but communities in streams in areas with a high mineral potential were as diverse as those in streams in areas with a low mineral potential. Mining impacts were better detected for diatoms using a reference condition based on sites with a high than low mineral potential, while for macroinvertebrates, the responses were generally less evident, likely because of only minor effects of mining on water chemistry. Community composition and frequencies of occurrence of macroinvertebrate taxa were, however, highly similar between mine-influenced streams and reference streams with a high potential for minerals indicating that the communities are strongly structured by the natural influence of mineral deposits. Incorporating geochemistry into the reference condition would likely improve bioassessments of both taxonomic groups. Replicated monitoring in potentially impacted sites and reference sites would be the most efficient framework for detecting environmental impacts in streams draining through mineral-rich catchments.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111532,33130404,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:57:48.329754-04:00,No,,

The FlowCAM data of microautotrophs representing two time series locations in the coastal environment along the southwest coast of India at 18 weekly/biweekly frequencies showed the following features. The most significant response of the microautotrophs to the eutrophication associated with coastal upwelling during the Southwest Monsoon (June-September) was an increase in their mean bio-volume, either by increasing the individual cell size or by forming large colonies. During the Southwest Monsoon, large colonies of Thalassiosira (~ 8 cells/colony), Thalassionema (&gt; 16 cells/colony), and Asterionellopsis (&gt; 8 cells/colony) become very abundant.

Exopolysaccharides are secreted mainly by primary colonisers, bacteria, which is succeeded by secondary colonisers i.e. diatoms. Both diatom (Nitzschia sp.4) and bacteria (Bacillus subtilis) were exposed with substrates separately for 30&#xa0;days. Diatoms adhere on substrates strongly, not only because of surface roughness of different substrates but also the nanoporous architecture of diatoms which enhanced their embellishment. This study attempted to identify the substrates that adhere to diatoms strongly and was mainly analyzed by scanning electron microscope and further the observations are well supported by math work software (MATLAB). The variation of diatom's binding on different substrates is due to the influence of marine litters on diatom population in ocean beds where they undergo slow degradation releasing macro, micro and nanoparticles besides radicals and ions causing cell death.

In this study, we described lipid compositional similarities and differences between periphyton, fish, and crustaceans, and explored if eutrophication and creation of new open-water sloughs in phosphorus (P)-impacted regions of a Northern Everglades impoundment resulted in changes in periphyton biomass and lipid composition, and the lipid composition of a ubiquitous omnivore, Gambusia holbrooki. Lipid biomarker analysis provided insight into microbial community composition, quality of basal resources, and potential resources utilized by consumers. Periphyton biomass and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition differed in response to eutrophication, but not between P-impacted control and treatment plots. Shifts in relative abundances of lipids indicative of diatoms and green algae mirrored known taxonomic shifts due to eutrophication. For fauna, PLFA were a small and relatively distinct component of the overall total lipid make-up, and profiles were similar between control and treatment plots. However, the PLFA profile of G. holbrooki differed between oligotrophic and eutrophic regions. Fish and crustacean lipids contained significantly greater relative abundances of polyunsaturated fatty acids than were found in periphyton, and profiles differed between fish and crustaceans, suggesting organisms were selectively accumulating or elongating and desaturating lipids de novo, to meet physiological needs.

This traditional approach is also time-consuming. Diatom metabarcoding is a promising alternative and there is increasing interest in using this approach for routine assessment. However, until now, analysis protocols for diatom metabarcoding have been developed and optimised by research groups working in isolation. The diversity of existing bioinformatics methods highlights the need for an assessment of the performance and comparability of results of different methods. The aim of this study was to test the correspondence of outputs from six bioinformatics pipelines currently in use for diatom metabarcoding in different European countries. Raw sequence data from 29 biofilm samples were treated by each of the bioinformatics pipelines, five of them using the same curated reference database. The outputs of the pipelines were compared in terms of sequence unit assemblages, taxonomic assignment, biotic index score and ecological assessment outcomes. The three last components were also compared to outputs from traditional light microscopy, which is currently accepted for ecological assessment of phytobenthos, as required by the Water Framework Directive. We also tested the performance of the pipelines on the two DNA markers (rbcL and 18S-V4) that are currently used by the working groups participating in this study. The sequence unit assemblages produced by different pipelines showed significant differences in terms of assigned and unassigned read numbers and sequence unit numbers. When comparing the taxonomic assignments at genus and species level, correspondence of the taxonomic assemblages between pipelines was weak. Most discrepancies were linked to differential detection or quantification of taxa, despite the use of the same reference database. Subsequent calculation of biotic index scores also showed significant differences between approaches, which were reflected in the final ecological assessment. Use of the rbcL marker always resulted in better correlation among molecular datasets and also in results closer to these generated using traditional microscopy. This study shows that decisions made in pipeline design have implications for the dataset's structure and the taxonomic assemblage, which in turn may affect biotic index calculation and ecological assessment. There is a need to define best-practice bioinformatics parameters in order to ensure the best representation of diatom assemblages. Only the use of similar parameters will ensure the compatibility of data from different working groups. The future of diatom metabarcoding for ecological assessment may also lie in the development of new metrics using, for example, presence/absence instead of relative abundance data.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140948,32736102,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 14:52:22.569068-04:00,No,,

Identifying ecological responses to phosphorus and nitrogen can inform decisions affecting the protection and management of streams and their watersheds. Diatoms are particularly useful because they are a highly diverse group of unicellular algae found in nearly all aquatic environments and are sensitive responders to increased nutrient concentrations. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding of stream diatoms as an approach to quantifying effects of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN). Threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN) identified operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that increased or decreased along TP and TN gradients along with nutrient concentrations at which assemblages had substantial changes in the occurrences and relative abundances of OTUs. Boosted regression trees showed that relative abundances of gene sequence reads for OTUs identified by TITAN as low P, high P, low N, or high N diatoms had strong relationships with nutrient concentrations, which provided support for potentially using these groups of diatoms as metrics in monitoring programs. Gradient forest analysis provided complementary information by characterizing multi-taxa assemblage change using multiple predictors and results from random forest models for each OTU. Collectively, these analyses showed that notable changes in diatom assemblage structure and OTUs began around 20&#xa0;&#xb5;g TP/L, low P diatoms decreased substantially and community change points occurred from 75 to 150&#xa0;&#xb5;g/L, and high P diatoms became increasingly dominant from 150 to 300&#xa0;&#xb5;g/L.

These diatom responses to TP and TN could be used to inform protection efforts (i.e., anti-degradation) and management goals (i.e., nutrient reduction) in streams and watersheds.

A new set of copolymers with varying amphiphilicities was synthesized and coated on chemically modified glass substrates. The antifouling capabilities were assessed against the diatom <i>Navicula perminuta</i> and multiple species in the field. Unsurprisingly, high diatom densities were observed on the hydrophobic control coatings. The integration of small zwitterionic contents of only &#x223c;5 wt % was already sufficient to rapidly form a hydrophilic interface that led to a strong reduction of fouling. Ultralow fouling was also observed for the pure zwitterionic coatings in laboratory experiments, but it failed when tested in the real ocean environment. We noticed that the ability to absorb large amounts of water and the diffuse nature of the interphase correlate with the adsorption of silt, which can mask the hydrophilic chemistries and facilitate the settlement of organisms.

Here, we conducted two cruises in the southern Sunda Shelf during spring and fall 2016 to investigate the community structure and dynamics of phytoplankton assemblages in relation to environmental factors combining microscopy and flow cytometry. Micro/nanophytoplankton communities changed from Trichodesmium spp. and diatoms co-dominance in spring to communities dominated by Trichodesmium spp. in fall. Diatoms were a highly diverse group, with 78 species, followed by dinoflagellates (35 species). Differences in average abundance of micro/nanophytoplankton between spring and fall might be attributed to the shift in dominance of Trichodesmium spp. and diatoms. Picophytoplankton characterized by a great abundance of picocyanobacteria were dominated by Synechococcus. The dynamics of picophytoplankton during spring and fall might be associated with the differences in dominant Synechococcus strains. Environmental variables had significant influence on the dynamics of phytoplankton communities, especially nitrate and silicate. Silicate was a major driver responsible for the variations of micro/nanophytoplankton. Low silicate potentially limited the diatom growth during fall, leading to the overwhelming dominance of Trichodesmium spp. Picophytoplankton showed positive correlations with nitrate and silicate, suggesting that these nutrients collectively controlled variations in picophytoplankton communities during spring and fall.",10.1007/s11356-020-08927-6,32333358,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:49:43.451273-04:00,No,,

The limits were established according to freshwater quality conditions and standards based on water use classes 1 and 2 determined in CONAMA 357 legislation and British Columbia. Canadian Water Quality Index categorization ranged from """"marginal"""" to """"excellent,"""" most sampling units were """"good"""" (71%), followed by """"fair"""" (12%) and """"excellent"""" (12%) water quality.

We have undertaken a 25-year monthly-sampling study on the phytoplankton of a meso-oligotrophic lake, paying attention to controlling factors of overall biomass (TB) and taxonomical group biomass (TGBs). Long-term series included decreased trends of TB and TGBs, and multi-scale periodicity. A decadal TB periodicity emerged related to nitrogen concentration and Cryptophytes. Annual periodicities were mainly related to air and water temperature controlling the abundance of Chlorophytes or Dinoflagellates. Intra-annual cycles could arise from autogenic processes. The analysis by periods revealed relevant dynamics (for example, Diatom periodicities), hidden in the analysis of the complete series. These results allow us to establish that: i) two organizational levels of phytoplankton change differently in time scales from months to decades; ii) controlling factors (climate, water physics and chemistry) act at different time scales and on different TGBs, and iii) different combinations of the """"taxonomical group-control factor-trend and periodicity"""" set throughout the studied time explain total biomass dynamics.

Despite reductions in anthropogenic nutrient inputs that have led to improvement in the chemical status of running waters, corresponding improvements in their ecological status are often not observed. We tested a novel combination of complementary statistical modeling approaches, including random-effect regression trees and compositional and ordinary linear mixed models, to examine the potential reasons for this disparity, using low-frequency regulatory data available to catchment managers. A benthic Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) was linked to potential stressors, including nutrient concentrations, soluble reactive P (SRP) loads from different sources, land cover, and catchment hydrological characteristics. Modeling suggested that SRP, traditionally considered the bioavailable component, may not be the best indicator of ecological impacts of P, as shown by a stronger and spatially more variable negative relationship between total P (TP) concentrations and TDI. Nitrate-N ( &lt; 0.001) and TP ( = 0.002) also showed negative relationship with TDI in models where land cover was not included. Land cover had the strongest influence on the ecological response. The positive effect of seminatural land cover ( &lt; 0.001) and negative effect of urban land cover ( = 0.030) may be related to differentiated bioavailability of P fractions in catchments with different characteristics (e.g., P loads from point vs. diffuse sources) as well as resilience factors such as hydro-morphology and habitat condition, supporting the need for further research into factors affecting this stressor-response relationship in different catchment types.

One of the constraints is the paucity of general principles applicable to community ecology. Based on a synecological analysis of a decadal-scale database, we created a niche habitat classification scheme relating nine phytoplankton groups to fifteen statistically refined realized niches comprised of three niche dimensions: temperature, irradiance, and nitrate concentrations. The niche scheme assigned the nine phytoplankton groups to three types of niches: a cold type, a warm type, and a type associated with high irradiance and high nitrate concentrations. The fact that phytoplankton groups in cold niches were governed by irradiance and those in warm niches by nitrate is consistent with general ecological theories, but the fact that diatoms were the only dominant group in high-irradiance, high-nitrate niches challenges the idea based on autecological studies that diatoms are generally better adapted to low-irradiance, high-nutrient conditions. When combined with an irradiance model, the niche scheme revealed that photoinhibition of Prochlorococcus, which is predicted from autecological studies, is a function of temperature. We used the niche scheme to predict the responses of phytoplankton communities to environmental changes due to seawater warming and eutrophication. The results of the study suggest that a synecological analysis of large databases from field studies facilitates identification of general principles of community ecology that can be used to forecast responses of biological communities to environmental changes.",10.1016/j.watres.2019.115070,31525510,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 00:49:18.674517-04:00,No,,

Nine transects were performed for the first time in deep-sea areas previously fully covered by ice, four of them in the Nansen Basin (3571-4066m) and five in the Amundsen Basin (4041-4384m). At seven of these stations benthic Agassiz trawls were taken near the camera tracks for species identification. Observed Arctic deep-sea megafauna was largely endemic. Several taxa showed a substantially greater depth or geographical range than previously assumed. Variations in the composition and structure of megabenthic communities were analysed and linked to several environmental variables, including state of the sea ice and phytodetritus supply to the seafloor. Three different types of communities were identified based on species dominating the biomass. Among these species were the actiniarian Bathyphellia margaritacea and the holothurians Elpidia heckeri and Kolga hyalina. Variations in megafaunal abundance were first of all related to the proximity to the marginal ice zone. Stations located closer to this zone were characterized by relatively high densities and biomass of B. margaritacea. Food supply was higher at these stations, as suggested by enhanced concentrations of pigments, organic carbon, bacterial cell abundances and nutrients in the sediments. Fully ice-covered stations closer to the North Pole and partially under multi-year ice were characterized by lower concentrations of the same biogeochemical indicators for food supply. These stations nevertheless hosted relatively high density and biomass of the holothurians E. heckeri or K. hyalina, which were observed to feed on large food falls of the sea-ice colonial diatom Melosira arctica.

One of the main sources of contamination comes from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents that contain wide range of micro- and macropollutants. Chemical composition, toxicity levels and impact of treated effluents (TEs) on the recipient aquatic ecosystems may strongly differ depending on the wastewater origin. Compared to urban TEs, hospital ones may contain more active pharmaceutical substances. Benthic diatoms are relevant ecological indicators because of their high species and ecological diversity and rapid response to human pressure. They are routinely used for water quality monitoring. However, there is a knowledge gap on diatom communities' development and behavior in treated wastewater in relation to prevailing micro- and macropollutants. In this study, we aim to (1) investigate the response of diatom communities to urban and hospital TEs, and (2) evaluate TEs effect on communities in the recipient river. Environmental biofilms were colonized in TEs and the recipient river up- and downstream from the WWTP output to study benthic diatoms using DNA metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS). In parallel, concentrations of nutrients, pharmaceuticals and seasonal conditions were recorded. Diatom metabarcoding showed that benthic communities differed strongly in their diversity and structure depending on the habitat. TE sites were generally dominated by few genera with polysaprobic preferences belonging to the motile guild, while river sites favored diverse communities from oligotrophic and oligosaprobic groups. Seasonal changes were visible to lower extent. To categorize parameters important for diatom changes we performed redundancy analysis which suggested that communities within TE sites were associated to higher concentrations of beta-blockers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in urban effluents vs. antibiotics and orthophosphate in hospital effluents. Furthermore, indicator species analysis showed that 27% of OTUs detected in river downstream communities were indicator for urban or hospital TE sites and were absent in the river upstream. Finally, biological diatom index (BDI) calculated to evaluate the ecological status of the recipient river suggested water quality decrease linked to the release of TEs. Thus, in-depth assessment of diatom community composition using DNA metabarcoding is proposed as a promising technique to highlight the disturbing effect of pollutants in Alpine rivers.",10.3389/fmicb.2019.00653,31024473,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:53:47.019003-04:00,No,,

However, mechanisms how multiple stressors act on aquatic community structure and functioning are poorly understood. This is especially true for two important stressors types, hydrodynamic alterations and toxicants. Here we perform a mesocosm experiment in hydraulic flumes connected as a bypass to a natural stream to test the interactive effects of both factors on natural (inoculated from streams water) biofilms. Biofilms, i.e., the community of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms and their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in association with substratum, are key players in stream functioning. We hypothesized (i) that the tolerance of biofilms toward toxicants (the herbicide Prometryn) decreases with increasing hydraulic stress. As EPS is known as an absorber of chemicals, we hypothesize (ii) that the EPS to cell ratio correlates with both hydraulic stress and herbicide tolerance. Tolerance values were derived from concentration-response assays. Both, the herbicide tolerance and the biovolume of the EPS significantly correlated with the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), while the diversity of diatoms (the dominant group within the stream biofilms) increased with flow velocity. This indicates that the positive effect of TKE on community tolerance was mediated by turbulence-induced changes in the EPS biovolume. This conclusion was supported by a second experiment, showing decreasing effects of the herbicide to a diatom biofilm (<i>Nitzschia palea</i>) with increasing content of artificial EPS.

PU, EP and PDMS deterred the development of marine biofilms by reducing the biofilm biomass including the biofilm dry weight, cell density of the bacteria and diatoms and chlorophyll a concentrations. Further analysis of bacterial community revealed that EP altered the bacterial community composition compared with that on the glass substrata by reducing the relative abundance of Ruegeria (Alphaproteobacteria) and by increasing the relative abundance of Methylotenera (Betaproteobacteria) and Cyanobacteria in the biofilms.

Uncultivated buffer zones or reforestation of riparian zones are advocated as a key management option that could compensate the harmful land use impacts. The effectiveness of riparian forests to protect ecological conditions of agricultural streams is yet inconclusive, particularly regarding the benefit of riparian buffers in streams suffering from uninterrupted agricultural diffuse pollution. We studied the effects of riparian land use on periphyton production and diatom, macrophyte and benthic macroinvertebrate communities in medium-sized agricultural streams by a) comparing 18 open field and forested agricultural stream reach pairs that only differed by the extent of riparian forest cover, and b) comparing the agricultural reaches to 15 near-natural streams. We found that periphyton abundance was higher in open reaches than in the forested reaches, but diatom community structure did not respond to the riparian forest cover. Macrophyte and macroinvertebrate communities were clearly affected by the riparian forest cover. Graminoids dominated in open reaches, whereas bryophytes were more abundant in forested reaches. Shredding invertebrates were more abundant in forested reaches compared to open reaches, but grazers did not differ between the reach types. Macrophyte trait composition and macroinvertebrate community difference between the reaches were positively related to the difference in riparian forest cover. The community structure of all three groups in the agricultural streams differed distinctly from the near-natural streams.

The first level in the marine food web is formed of planktonic and benthic photosynthetic microorganisms, which form a biofilm on the surface of the hard bottom (epilithon) or plants (epiphyton). They are carriers of nutritional as well as toxic substances and pass these on to subsequent levels of the trophic web. Their biomass is often dominated by diatoms. This was the basis for the presented study into Hg accumulation in epilithic, epiphytic and planktonic diatoms, which was carried out in 2012-2013 in the coastal zone of the Puck Lagoon and the Gulf of Gda&#x144;sk (southern Baltic). In this coastal area, both micro- and macroorganisms develop particularly intensively. The collected results indicate an increase in Hg concentration in the biofilm during the warm season which, with the lengthening of the vegetative period due to global warming in recent years, is of great significance. As a consequence, the annual mercury load entering the trophic web is larger in comparison with a year in which there is a long, cold winter. An important parameter influencing the accumulation of Hg was the function of those organisms from the biofilm-forming communities.

At the same time, two mating types (""""male"""" and """"female"""") were recognized by the distinct morphology and behaviour of the gametes. While no flagella were observed, periodically thin cytoplasmic projections arose on the surface of the """"male"""" gametes.

Ponds are highly dynamic and challenging environments and display a wide range of trophic conditions. In farms affected by vibriosis, phytoplankton biomass and composition are highly variable. These conditions may promote the development of harmful algae increasing shrimp susceptibility to bacterial infections. Phytoplankton compartment before and during mortality outbreaks was monitored at a shrimp farm that has been regularly and highly impacted by these diseases. Combining information from flow cytometry, microscopy, pigment and phylogenetic analysis, the presence of Picocyanobacteria, Prasinophyceae and Diatomophyceae were detected as dominant phytoplankton groups and Cryptophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae and Dinophyceae as minor components. At the onset of the first shrimp mortalities, Bacillariophyceae increased while Cyanobacteria, Prymnesiophyceae and Dinophyceae decreased in the water column, followed by proliferation of Prasinophyceae.

Due to this unique combination of genes, diatoms are taxonomically and functionally distinct from other algae and vascular plants and confer novel metabolic capabilities. Based on the genome annotation, we performed a genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction for the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Due to their endosymbiotic origin, diatoms possess a complex chloroplast structure which complicates the prediction of subcellular protein localization. Based on previous work we implemented a pipeline that exploits a series of bioinformatics tools to predict protein localization. The manually curated reconstructed metabolic network iLB1027_lipid accounts for 1,027 genes associated with 4,456 reactions and 2,172 metabolites distributed across six compartments. To constrain the genome-scale model, we determined the organism specific biomass composition in terms of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. Our simulations indicate the presence of a yet unknown glutamine-ornithine shunt that could be used to transfer reducing equivalents generated by photosynthesis to the mitochondria. The model reflects the known biochemical composition of P. tricornutum in defined culture conditions and enables metabolic engineering strategies to improve the use of P. tricornutum for biotechnological applications.",10.1371/journal.pone.0155038,27152931,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:46:25.325889-04:00,No,,

Plankton elemental concentration and stoichiometry are key variables in phytoplankton ecophysiology and ocean biogeochemistry, and are used to link cells and ecosystems. However, most field studies rely on bulk techniques that overestimate carbon and nitrogen because the samples include organic matter other than plankton organisms. Here we used X-ray microanalysis (XRMA), a technique that, unlike bulk analyses, gives simultaneous quotas of C, N, O, Mg, Si, P, and S, in single-cell organisms that can be collected directly from the sea. We analysed the elemental composition of dinoflagellates and diatoms (largely Chaetoceros spp.) collected from different sites of the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean Sea). As expected, a lower C content is found in our cells compared to historical values of cultured cells. Our results indicate that, except for Si and O in diatoms, the mass of all elements is not a constant fraction of cell volume but rather decreases with increasing cell volume. Also, diatoms are significantly less dense in all the measured elements, except Si, compared to dinoflagellates. The N:P ratio of both groups is higher than the Redfield ratio, as it is the N:P nutrient ratio in deep NW Mediterranean Sea waters (N:P = 20-23). The results suggest that the P requirement is highest for bacterioplankton, followed by dinoflagellates, and lowest for diatoms, giving them a clear ecological advantage in P-limited environments like the Mediterranean Sea. Finally, the P concentration of cells of the same genera but growing under different nutrient conditions was the same, suggesting that the P quota of these cells is at a critical level. Our results indicate that XRMA is an accurate technique to determine single cell elemental quotas and derived conversion factors used to understand and model ocean biogeochemical cycles.",10.1371/journal.pone.0154050,27111067,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-14 12:49:17.870390-04:00,No,,

Dissolved oxygen falls from 20 mg liter(-1) to undetectable over one vertical meter from 8.9- to 9.9-m depth. We provide the first description of the benthic mat community that falls within this oxygen gradient on the sloping floor of the lake, using a combination of micro- and macroscopic morphological descriptions, pigment analysis, and 16S rRNA gene bacterial community analysis. Our work focused on three macroscopic mat morphologies that were associated with different parts of the oxygen gradient: (i) """"cuspate pinnacles"""" in the upper hyperoxic zone, which displayed complex topography and were dominated by phycoerythrin-rich cyanobacteria attributable to the genus Leptolyngbya and a diverse but sparse assemblage of pennate diatoms; (ii) a less topographically complex """"ridge-pit"""" mat located immediately above the oxic-anoxic transition containing Leptolyngbya and an increasing abundance of diatoms; and (iii) flat prostrate mats in the upper anoxic zone, dominated by a green cyanobacterium phylogenetically identified as Phormidium pseudopriestleyi and a single diatom, Diadesmis contenta. Zonation of bacteria was by lake depth and by depth into individual mats. Deeper mats had higher abundances of bacteriochlorophylls and anoxygenic phototrophs, including Chlorobi and Chloroflexi. This suggests that microbial communities form assemblages specific to niche-like locations. Mat morphologies, underpinned by cyanobacterial and diatom composition, are the result of local habitat conditions likely defined by irradiance and oxygen and sulfide concentrations.""",10.1128/AEM.02699-15,26567300,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:59:12.019284-04:00,No,,

As a group unambiguously recognized as diatoms, they seem to have appeared relatively recently with a limited record of putative remains from oldest sediments. In contrast, molecular clock estimates for the earliest possible emergence of diatoms suggest a considerably older date. Depending on the analysis, Paralia and Leptocylindrus have been recovered within the basal molecular divergences of diatoms. Thus these genera may be in the position to inform on characters that the earliest diatoms possessed. Here we present auxospore development and structure of initial and post-auxospore cells in a representative of the ancient non-polar centric genus Paralia. Their initial frustules showed unusual, but not unprecedented, spore-like morphology. Similarly, initial frustules of Leptocylindrus have been long considered resting spores and a unique peculiarity of this genus. However, even though spore-like in appearance, initial cells of Paralia readily resumed mitotic divisions. In addition, Paralia post-auxospore cells underwent several rounds of mitoses in a multi-step process of building a typical, """"perfect"""" vegetative valve. This degree of heteromorphy immediately post-auxosporulation is thus far unknown among the diatoms. A spore-related origin of diatoms has already been considered, most recently in the form of the """"multiplate diploid cyst"""" hypothesis. Our discovery that the initial cells in some of the most ancient diatom lineages are structurally spore-like is consistent with that hypothesis because the earliest diatoms may be expected to look somewhat similar to their ancestors. We speculate that because the earliest diatoms may have appeared less diatom-like and more spore-like, they could have gone unrecognized as such in the Triassic/Jurassic sediments. If correct, diatoms may indeed be much older than the fossil record indicates, and possibly more in line with some molecular clock predictions.""",10.1371/journal.pone.0141150,26485144,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 15:46:57.422488-04:00,No,,

Here we report the ubiquitous presence of healthy photosynthetic cells, dominated by diatoms, down to 4,000 m in the deep dark ocean. Decay experiments with surface phytoplankton suggested that the large proportion (18%) of healthy photosynthetic cells observed, on average, in the dark ocean, requires transport times from a few days to a few weeks, corresponding to sinking rates (124-732 m d(-1)) comparable to those of fast-sinking aggregates and faecal pellets.

Total concentrations of metals, as well as the potentially bioavailable fraction of metals in sediment has also been analyzed by the application of the sequential extraction method (BCR method). In order to evaluate the influence of metal pollution on the river ecological status, according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), diverse biological indices such as macroinvertebrates (IBMWP), diatoms (IPS) and macrophytes (IVAM), have been considered from an integrated point of view.

Natural benthic algal communities (periphyton) have been exposed to Hg under present and future temperature scenarios (rise of 5 &#xb0;C). The modulating effect of other factors (also altered by global change), as the quality and amount of suspended and dissolved materials in the rivers, has been also assessed, exposing algae to Hg in natural river water or a synthetic medium. The EC50 values ranged from the 0.15-0.74 ppm for the most sensitive communities, to the 24-40 ppm for the most tolerant. The higher tolerance shown by communities exposed to higher Hg concentrations, as Jabarrella was in agreement with the Pollution Induced Community Tolerance concept. In other cases, the dominance of the invasive diatom Didymosphenia geminata explained the tolerance or sensitivity of the community to the Hg toxicity. Results shown that while increases in the suspended solids reduced Hg bioavailability, changes in the dissolved materials - such as organic carbon - may increase it and thus its toxic effects on biota. The impacts of the increase of temperatures on the toxicological behaviour of periphyton (combining both changes at species composition and physiological acclimation) would be certainly modulated by other effects at the land level (i.e., alterations in the amount and quality of dissolved and particulate substances arriving to the rivers).",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.05.042,26024757,Not Neotoma,No,SimonGoring,2023-05-15 00:53:29.204567-04:00,No,,
