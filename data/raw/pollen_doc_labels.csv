"8","A recent Cannabis pollen increase on the Iberian Pyrenees.","37160180","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163947","""The continuous, varved and absolutely dated sedimentary record of Lake Montcort&#xe8;s (Iberian Pyrenees) has provided evidence for a distinct and characteristic 20th century (1980s) increase in Cannabis pollen (20C) that persists today. This event was coeval with the geographical shift of the hemp production center in the Iberian Peninsula from east to northeast (where Lake Montcort&#xe8;s lies), which was accompanied by a significant production increase. This increasing trend was fostered by the renewed interest of the paper industry in hemp and was promoted by the onset of European Union subsidies to hemp cultivation. Illegal cannabis crops could have also contributed to the Cannabis pollen increase, but sound evidence is still lacking. These preliminary conclusions should be reinforced by increasing the resolution of the current palynological record and modeling the dispersal of Cannabis pollen around the Montcort&#xe8;s region. More similar high-resolution records are needed to verify the geographical extent of the 20C event. Additionally, Lake Montcort&#xe8;s varved sediments are proposed as a suitable candidate to characterize the onset of the """"Anthropocene"""" epoch (mid-20th century), as currently defined by the Anthropocene Working Group.""","05","2023","09","Sci Total Environ","The Science of the total environment","20th century; Cannabis; Cultivation; Hemp; Iberian Peninsula; Pollen; Pyrenees; Retting","","","","","Neotoma","No","This article is a prime candidate for inclusion in Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:14:07.796525-04:00","No","","NaT"
"30","Witnessing history: comparison of a century of sedimentary and written records in a California protected area.","37125024","10.1007/s10113-023-02056-9","We use a combination of proxy records from a high-resolution analysis of sediments from Searsville Lake and adjacent Upper Lake Marsh and historical records to document over one and a half centuries of vegetation and socio-ecological change-relating to logging, agricultural land use change, dam construction, chemical applications, recreation, and other drivers-on the San Francisco Peninsula. A relatively open vegetation with minimal oak (<i>Quercus</i>) and coast redwood (<i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>) in the late 1850s reflects widespread logging and grazing during the nineteenth century. Forest and woodland expansion occurred in the early twentieth century, with forests composed of coast redwood and oak, among other taxa, as both logging and grazing declined. Invasive species include those associated with pasturage (<i>Rume</i> <i>x</i>, <i>Plantago</i>), landscape disturbance (<i>Urtica</i>, Amaranthaceae), planting for wood production and wind barriers (<i>Eucalyptus</i>), and agriculture. Agricultural species, including wheat, rye, and corn, were more common in the early twentieth century than subsequently. Wetland and aquatic pollen and fungal spores document a complex hydrological history, often associated with fluctuating water levels, application of algaecides, raising of Searsville Dam, and construction of a levee. By pairing the paleoecological and historical records of both lakes, we have been able to reconstruct the previously undocumented impacts of socio-ecological influences on this drainage, all of which overprinted known climate changes. Recognizing the ecological manifestations of these impacts puts into perspective the extent to which people have interacted with and transformed the environment in the transition into the Anthropocene.

"62","Large mammals and trees in eastern monsoonal China: anthropogenic losses since the Late Pleistocene and restoration prospects in the Anthropocene.","37102332","10.1111/brv.12968","Massive human-induced declines of large-sized animals and trees (megabiota) from the Late Pleistocene to the Anthropocene have resulted in downsized ecosystems across the globe, in which components and functions have been greatly simplified. In response, active restoration projects of extant large-sized species or functional substitutes are needed at large scales to promote ecological processes that are important for ecosystem self-regulation and biodiversity maintenance. Despite the desired global scope of such projects, they have received little attention in East Asia. Here, we synthesise the biogeographical and ecological knowledge of megabiota in ancient and modern China, with relevant data mostly located in eastern monsoonal China (EMC), aiming to assess its potential for restoring functionally intact ecosystems modulated by megabiota. We found that during the Late Pleistocene, 12 mammalian megafaunal (carnivores &#x2265;15&#x2009;kg and herbivores &#x2265;500&#x2009;kg) species disappeared from EMC: one carnivore Crocuta ultima (East Asian spotted hyena) and 11 herbivores including six megaherbivores (&#x2265;1000&#x2009;kg). The relative importance of climate change and humans in driving these losses remains debated, despite accumulating evidence in favour of the latter. Later massive depletion of megafauna and large-sized (45-500&#x2009;kg) herbivores has been closely associated with agricultural expansion and societal development, especially during the late Holocene. While forests rich in large timber trees (33 taxa in written records) were common in the region 2000-3000&#x2009;years ago, millennial-long logging has resulted in considerable range contractions and at least 39 threatened species. The wide distribution of C. ultima, which likely favoured open or semi-open habitats (like extant spotted hyenas), suggests the existence of mosaic open and closed vegetation in the Late Pleistocene across EMC, in line with a few pollen-based vegetation reconstructions and potentially, or at least partially, reflecting herbivory by herbivorous megafauna. The widespread loss of megaherbivores may have strongly compromised seed dispersal for both megafruit (fleshy fruits with widths &#x2265;40&#x2009;mm) and non-megafruit plant species in EMC, especially in terms of extra-long-distance (&gt;10&#x2009;km) dispersal, which is critical for plant species that rely on effective biotic agents to track rapid climate change. The former occurrence of large mammals and trees have translated into rich material and non-material heritages passed down across generations. Several reintroduction projects have been implemented or are under consideration, with the case of Elaphurus davidianus a notable success in recovering wild populations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, although trophic interactions with native carnivorous megafauna have not yet been restored. Lessons of dealing with human-wildlife conflicts are key to public support for maintaining landscapes shared with megafauna and large herbivores in the human-dominated Anthropocene. Meanwhile, potential human-wildlife conflicts, e.g. public health risks, need to be scientifically informed and effectively reduced. The Chinese government's strong commitment to improved policies of ecological protection and restoration (e.g. ecological redlines and national parks) provides a solid foundation for a scaling-up contribution to the global scope needed for solving the crisis of biotic downsizing and ecosystem degradation.","04","2023","27","Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc","Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society","Late Quaternary extinctions; biocultural diversity; biotic interactions; endozoochoric dispersers; human-nature coexistence; palaeoecology; trophic rewilding; vegetation history","","","","","Neotoma","No","This article is a prime candidate for inclusion in Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:19:12.834820-04:00","No","","NaT"
"84","Fossil pollen resolves origin of the South African Proteaceae as transcontinental not transoceanic.","37076271","10.1093/aob/mcad055","The prevailing view from the areocladogenesis of molecular phylogenies is that the iconic South African Cape Proteaceae (subfamily Proteoideae) arrived from Australia across the Indian Ocean in the Upper Cretaceous (100&#x2012;65 million years ago, Ma). Since fossil pollen indicates that the family probably arose in North-West Africa during the early Cretaceous, an alternative view is that it migrated to the Cape from North-Central Africa. The plan therefore was to collate fossil pollen records throughout Africa to determine if they are consistent with an African (para-autochthonous) origin for the Cape Proteaceae, and to seek further support from other paleo-disciplines. Palynology (identity, date and location of records), molecular phylogeny and chronogram preparation, biogeography of plate tectonics, and paleo-atmospheric and ocean circulation models. Our collation of the rich assemblage of Proteaceae palynomorphs stretching back to 107 Ma (Triorites africaensis) in North-West Africa showed its progressive overland migration to the Cape by 75&#x2012;65 Ma. No key palynomorphs recorded in Australia-Antarctica have morphological affinities with African fossils but specific clade assignment of the preMiocene records is not currently possible. The Cape Proteaceae encompass three molecular-based clades (tribes) whose most-recent apparent ancestors are sisters to those in Australia. However, our chronogram shows that the major Adenanthos/Leucadendron-related clade, originating 54&#x2012;34 Ma, would have 'arrived' too late as species with Proteaceae affinities were already present ~20 My earlier. The Franklandia/Protea-related clade arose 118&#x2012;81 Ma so its distinctive pollen should have been the foundation for the scores of palynomorphs recorded at 100&#x2012;80 Ma but it was not. Also, the prevailing winds and ocean currents trended away from South Africa rather than towards, as the 'out-of-Australia' hypothesis requires. Based on the evidence assembled here, we list three points favouring an Australian origin and nine against; four points favouring an Antarctic origin and seven against; and nine points favouring a North-Central African origin and three against. We conclude that a gradual migration of the Proteaceae from North-Central Africa southeast&#x2192;south&#x2192;southwest to the Cape and surrounds occurred via adaptation and speciation during the period 90&#x2012;70 Ma. We caution that incorrect conclusions may be drawn from literal interpretations of molecular phylogenies that neglect the fossil record and do not recognize the possible confounding effects of selection under matched environments leading to parallel evolution and extinction of bona fide sister clades.","04","2023","19","Ann Bot","Annals of botany"," Protea ;  Proteacidites ;  Triorites africaensis ; Australia; Cape of South Africa; Cretaceous; Proteaceae; kimberlite (Arnot) pipes; paleobiogeography; paleofire; palynomorphs; transoceanic dispersal","","","","","Neotoma","No","This article is a prime candidate for inclusion in Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:41:27.364467-04:00","No","","NaT"

During the middle Eocene (~40 Ma), the Cordillera at these latitudes was barely uplifted and global climates were much warmer than today. No fossil plant remains have been discovered so far from this age in the Puna region to attest to past scenarios. Yet, we assume that the vegetation cover must have been very different from what it looks today. To test this hypothesis, we study a spore-pollen record from the mid Eocene Casa Grande Formation (Jujuy, northwestern Argentina). Although sampling is preliminary, we found ~70 morphotypes of spores, pollen grains and other palynomorphs, many of which were produced by taxa with tropical or subtropical modern distributions (e.g., Arecaceae, Ulmaceae Phyllostylon, Malvaceae Bombacoideae). Our reconstructed scenario implies the existence of a vegetated pond surrounded by trees, vines, and palms. We also report the northernmost records of a few unequivocal Gondwanan taxa (e.g., Nothofagus, Microcachrys), about 5,000 km north from their Patagonian-Antarctic hotspot. With few exceptions, the discovered taxa-both Neotropical and Gondwanan-became extinct from the region following the severe effects of the Andean uplift and the climate deterioration during the Neogene. We found no evidence for enhanced aridity nor cool conditions in the southern Central Andes at mid Eocene times. Instead, the overall assemblage represents a frost-free and humid to seasonally-dry ecosystem that prevailed near a lacustrine environment, in agreement with previous paleoenvironmental studies. Our reconstruction adds a further biotic component to the previously reported record of mammals.","04","2023","07","PLoS One","PloS one","Animals; Argentina; Ecosystem; Climate; Pollen; Plants; Fossils; Arecaceae; Spores; Mammals","","","","","Neotoma","No","This article is a prime candidate for inclusion in Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:51:05.875665-04:00","No","","NaT"

However, the rate and pattern of vegetation succession in response to large-scale climatic events during this interval are controversial. Here, we present well-dated decadal-resolution pollen records from annually laminated Maar Lake Xiaolongwan during the last deglaciation. The vegetation changes were rapid and near-synchronous with millennial-scale climatic events, including Greenland Stadial 2.1a (GS-2.1a), Greenland Interstadial 1 (GI-1), Greenland Stadial 1 (GS-1), and the early Holocene (EH). The vegetation responded in different ways to the different rates of climate change. Vegetation change was gradual [&#x223c;1 thousand years (kyr) response time] during the transition between GS-2.1a and GI-1, but it was faster (&#x223c;0.4 kyr response time) during the transitions between GI-1, GS-1, and the EH, resulting in different patterns of vegetation succession. Additionally, the amplitude and pattern of vegetation changes resembled those in the records of regional climate change based on long-chain <i>n</i>-alkanes &#x3b4;<sup>13</sup>C and stalagmite &#x3b4;<sup>18</sup>O, as well as in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere temperature record and the Greenland ice core &#x3b4;<sup>18</sup>O record. Therefore, the rate and pattern of vegetation succession in the Changbai Mountain of Northeast Asia during the last deglaciation were sensitive to the characteristics of changes in the regional hydrothermal conditions and mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere temperature, which were linked to both high- and low-latitude atmospheric-oceanic dynamics. Overall, our findings reveal a close relationship between ecosystem succession and hydrothermal changes during these millennial-scale climatic events in East Asia during the last deglaciation.","04","2023","04","PNAS Nexus","PNAS nexus","last deglacial; lead-lag relationship; pollen; succession rate","","","","","Neotoma","No","This article is a prime candidate for inclusion in Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:23:40.213305-04:00","No","","NaT"

However, there are few records of quantitative climate reconstruction dating to the last glacial cycle in areas dominated by the Asian summer monsoon. Here, using a pollen-based quantitative climate reconstruction based on three sites in areas exposed to the Asian summer monsoon, we demonstrate that climate has undergone great variability over the past 68&#xa0;ka. The differences between the last glacial and the Holocene optimum could have been as much as 35%-51% for precipitation, and 5-7&#xa0;&#xb0;C for mean annual temperature. Our findings also reveal regional heterogeneity during the abrupt climate events of Heinrich Event 1 and Younger Dryas, that drove drier conditions in southwestern China dominated by the Indian summer monsoon, and a wetter climate in central eastern China. The pattern of variation in reconstructed precipitation, exhibiting strong glacial-interglacial variability, is broadly consistent with the stalagmite &#x3b4;<sup>18</sup>O records from Southwest China and South Asia. Our results of reconstruction quantify the sensitivity of the MIS3 precipitation to orbital insolation changes, and highlight the prominent influence of interhemispheric temperature gradients on Asian monsoon variability.

However, the ecological effects and long-term ecological context of """"agricultural improvement"""" are not yet fully understood. To develop this understanding, we analyze paleoecological data (pollen, coprophilous fungal spores, microcharcoal) from five upland peatland sites using a range of analytical approaches: cluster analysis, principal component analysis, rate-of-change analysis, and regression analyses incorporating documentary historical data. The sites are located on Exmoor (South West England, UK), a landscape that typifies historic upland degradation. We demonstrate that in this landscape, 19th century drainage is associated with declines in <i>Sphagnum</i> and non-arboreal taxon richness; over longer timescales burning is associated with enhanced graminoid monocot abundance and grazing with lower taxon richness. We also show that rate-of-change in moorland vegetation communities during the 19th century is not distinctive in a long-term context: change has been a constant in this landscape, rather than an exception during the 19th century.

From the late Albian to the early Cenomanian, the northern and eastern parts of Iberia were the location of the desert system represented by deposits assigned to the Utrillas Group, which bear abundant amber with numerous bioinclusions, including diverse arthropods and vertebrate remains. In the Maestrazgo Basin (E Spain), the late Albian to early Cenomanian sedimentary succession represents the most distal part of the desert system (fore-erg) that was characterised by an alternation of aeolian and shallow marine sedimentary environments in the proximity of the Western Tethys palaeo-coast, with rare to frequent dinoflagellate cysts. The terrestrial ecosystems from this area were biodiverse, and comprised plant communities whose fossils are associated with sedimentological indicators of aridity. The palynoflora dominated by wind-transported conifer pollen is interpreted to reflect various types of xerophytic woodlands from the hinterlands and the coastal settings. Therefore, fern and angiosperm communities abundantly grew in wet interdunes and coastal wetlands (temporary to semi-permanent freshwater/salt marshes and water bodies). In addition, the occurrence of low-diversity megafloral assemblages reflects the existence of coastal salt-influenced settings. The palaeobotanical study carried out in this paper which is an integrative work on palynology and palaeobotany, does not only allow the reconstruction of the vegetation that developed in the mid-Cretaceous fore-erg from the eastern Iberia, in addition, provides new biostratigraphic and palaeogeographic data considering the context of angiosperm radiation as well as the biota inferred in the amber-bearing outcrops of San Just, Arroyo de la Pascueta and La Hoya (within Cortes de Arenoso succesion). Importantly, the studied assemblages include Afropollis, Dichastopollenites, Cretacaeiporites together with pollen produced by Ephedraceae (known for its tolerance to arid conditions).

(2) We reconstructed environmental changes at Holcroft Moss before and after the Industrial Revolution using a decadal-scale record of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, microcharcoal, peat composition (organic content and ash-free bulk density) and heavy metal content, constrained by a radiocarbon and SCP (spheroidal carbonaceous particle) chronology. We examine the relationship between abiotic and biotic environmental tracers using principal component analysis and evaluate the role of local and regional climatic and anthropogenic drivers using canonical redundancy analysis and partitioning of variation.

Prior to 1750&#x2009;CE, climate and agro-pastoral activity (grazing and fires) were the main drivers of vegetation change. Subsequently, regional coal-fired industry contributed to major increases in atmospheric pollutants (dust, heavy metals, and acid deposition) that severely impacted vegetation, driving the decline of <i>Sphagnum</i>. Grasses rose to dominance in the 20th century associated especially with bog conversion and cumulative nitrogen deposition.

Results from the most reliable REVEALS scenarios show that from the mid-Holocene, steppe (mean cover 40.6%) and dry steppe (mean cover 54.2%) alternately dominated the central part of the Songnen grasslands while the marginal grasslands were mainly characterized by alternating broadleaved forests (mean cover 26.3%), coniferous forests (mean cover 41.9%) and dry steppes (mean cover 30.1%). By comparing the plant cover results with previous published regional climate, fire and human activity records, the results show that long term vegetation dynamics were mainly driven by East Asia Summer Monsoon (EASM) and the related precipitation variations, but was also affected by fire frequency and human activity. Moreover, vegetation evolution was sensitive to abrupt cooling events including the 4.2 ka BP and stacked ice-rafted debris (IRD) events; the change from steppe to dry steppe, for example, was driven by these abrupt climate changes. Fire events can alter the original vegetation stability allowing the vegetation to respond rapidly to climate changes while human activity merely has limited influence on vegetation changes.","02","2023","02","Front Plant Sci","Frontiers in plant science","4.2 ka BP event; EASM; REVEALS (Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites) model; holocene; pollen","","","","","Neotoma","No","This article is a prime candidate for inclusion in Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:23:24.643652-04:00","No","","NaT"

Still, the direction and intensity of moisture transport across Eurasia towards potential ice-sheets is poorly constrained. To reconstruct late MPT moisture production and dispersal, we combine records of upper ocean temperature and pollen-based Mediterranean forest cover, a tracer of westerlies and precipitation, from a subtropical drill-core collected off South-West Iberia, with records of East Asia summer monsoon (EASM) strength and West Pacific surface temperatures, and model simulations. Here we show that south-western European winter precipitation and EASM strength reached high levels during the Marine Isotope Stage 18 glacial. This anomalous situation was caused by nearly-continuous moisture supply from both oceans and its transport to higher latitudes through the westerlies, likely fuelling the accelerated expansion of northern hemisphere ice-sheets during the late MPT.","05","2023","11","Nat Commun","Nature communications","","","","","","Maybe Neotoma","No","This article may have data that is relevant, but it's not immediately clear.","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:13:40.572001-04:00","No","","NaT"

Composed entirely of iron-oxyhydroxide, McGraths Flat rocks cannot be processed using typical microfossil extraction protocols e.g., acid digestion.

In the 1950s, a small network of ecologists challenged this view in collaboration with archeologists who used the new tool of radiocarbon dating. The Pleistocene overkill hypothesis imagined human hunting, not climate change, to be the primary cause of megafaunal extinction. This article situates the Pleistocene overkill hypothesis in a broader history of the emergence of historical ecology as a distinct sub-discipline of paleoecology. Tracing the work of the Yale Geochronometric Laboratory and an interdisciplinary research network that included Paul Sears, Richard Foster Flint, Edward Deevey, Kathryn Clisby, and Paul S.

First used as a tool for fossil fuel extraction, fossil pollen became a means of envisioning climatic history, and ultimately, a means of reimagining global ecological history. First through pollen stratigraphy and then through radiocarbon dating, ecologists reconstructed past biotic communities and rethought the role of humans in these communities.

Its regional economic importance dates at least to the Early Bronze Age (~3600 BCE) and its cultivation contributed significantly to the culture and heritage of ancient civilizations in the region. In the southern Levant, pollen, pits and wood remains of wild olives (<i>O. europaea</i> subsp. <i>europaea</i> var. <i>sylvestris</i>) has been found in Middle Pleistocene sediments dating to approximately 780 kya, and are present in numerous palynological sequences throughout the Pleistocene and into the Holocene. Archeological evidence indicates the olive oil production from at least the Pottery Neolithic to Chalcolithic transition (~7600-7000 BP), and clear evidence for cultivation by, 7000 BP. It is hypothesized that olive cultivation began through the selection of local genotypes of the wild var. <i>sylvestris</i>. Local populations of naturally growing trees today have thus been considered wild relatives of the olive. However, millennia of cultivation raises questions about whether genuine populations of var. sylvestris remain in the region. Ancient olive landraces might thus represent an ancient genetic stock closer to the ancestor gene pool. This review summarizes the evidence supporting the theory that olives were first cultivated in the southern Levant and reviews our genetic work characterizing local ancient cultivars. The significance and importance of old cultivars and wild populations are discussed, given the immediate need to adapt agricultural practices and crops to environmental degradation and global climate change.","03","2023","14","Front Plant Sci","Frontiers in plant science","archaeobotany; crop wild relatives; landraces; olives; palynology","","","","","Maybe Neotoma","No","This article may have data that is relevant, but it's not immediately clear.","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:21:37.321329-04:00","No","","NaT"

Even though Gondwana sediments are generally considered as fluvio-lacustrine deposits, recent studies indicate marine inundations with patchy records. Here in the present study, an attempt has been made to address the changeover from fluviatile to shallow marine conditions and also to address the palaeodepositional aspects. Luxuriant vegetation during deposition of the Lower Barakar Formation generated thick coal seams. The macroplant fossil assemblage shows Glossopteridales, Cordaitales and Equisetales comprising one palynoassemblage with the dominance of bisaccate pollen grains having glossopterid affinities. However, Lycopsids are absent in the megafloral record and are represented in megaspore assemblage. The present floral assemblage led to envisage the presence of dense forest with swampy conditions and prevalence of warm and humid climate during the deposition of Barakar sediments. Correlation with the coeval Indian assemblages and those from other Gondwanan continents also supports an Artinskian age and reveals a stronger affinity with flora of Africa than that of South America. Biomarker analysis reveals low pristane/phytane values (0.30-0.84), noticeable absence of hopanoid triterpenoids and long-chain n-alkanes that is attributed to the obliteration of organic compounds and subsequent alteration of composition due to thermal effect.

This is especially the case for terrestrial temperature variability, which is currently thought to be weak over long timescales. By performing spectral analysis on climate reconstructions, produced using sedimentary pollen records from the Northern Hemisphere over the last 8,000 years, coupled with instrumental data, we provide a comprehensive estimate of regional temperature variability from annual to millennial timescales. We show that short-term random variations are overprinted by strong ocean-driven climate variability on multi-decadal and longer timescales. This may cause substantial and potentially unpredictable regional climatic shifts in the coming century, in contrast to the relatively muted and homogeneous warming projected by climate models. Due to the marine influence, regions characterized by stable oceanic climate at sub-decadal timescales experience stronger long-term variability, and continental regions with higher sub-decadal variability show weaker long-term variability. This fundamental relationship between the timescales provides a unique insight into the emergence of a marine-driven low-frequency regime governing terrestrial climate variability and sets the basis to project the amplitude of temperature fluctuations on multi-decadal timescales and longer.","05","2023","01","Nat Geosci","Nature geoscience","","","","","","Maybe Neotoma","No","This article may have data that is relevant, but it's not immediately clear.","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:41:00.237836-04:00","No","","NaT"

"380","Microscopical palynology: Birch woodland expansion and species hybridisation coincide with periods of climate warming during the Holocene epoch in Iceland.","36779661","10.1111/jmi.13175","Introgressive hybridisation between arctic dwarf birch (Betula nana) and European downy birch (B.&#xa0;pubescens) is relatively common in natural woodlands in Iceland. As dwarf birch is a diploid species and downy tree birch a tetraploid species, their hybrids are triploid. In the introgression process, triploid hybrids, which are partially fertile, can backcross with the parental species, producing progenies comprising introgressed diploid, triploid and tetraploid plants. Triploid plants produce both normal triporate pollen (with three pores) and abnormal, aborted pollen, due to dysfunctional meiosis. The type of pollen abnormality that can be detected and quantified is non-triporate pollen (with four or more pores in the pollen wall). We therefore used the presence of non-triporate pollen as a marker to trace birch hybridisation in the past. In the current study we examined fossil pollen in samples from Holocene sediments from three locations: Gr&#xed;msnes (SW), Eyjafj&#xf6;rdur (N) and Thistilsfj&#xf6;rdur (NE Iceland). All three peat monoliths had the starting age of 10.3&#xa0;cal. ka BP. Ages were calibrated based on known tephra layers and by radiocarbon dating. The size of Betula pollen grains was measured, and the species proportions calculated from size. Non-triporate grains were detected in samples from all three locations and throughout the Holocene, but with different frequencies. The peaks of intense hybridisation followed birch woodland expansion in two major periods of the Holocene, both coinciding with a warming of climate. The first period occurred in the Early Holocene, around 9.5-7&#xa0;cal. ka BP, when the climate warmed rapidly after deglaciation. The second period occurred around 5-3.5&#xa0;cal. ka BP, well within the mid-Holocene Northern Hemisphere warming. A new wave of birch hybridisation appears to have started in the last few decades as the climate has warmed. Birch woodlands are likely to become more widespread. Introgressed shrub birch is likely to be more competitive over dwarf birch.","02","2023","28","J Microsc","Journal of microscopy","Betula; downy birch; dwarf birch; palaeopalynology; pollen; triploid hybrid","","","","","Maybe Neotoma","No","This article may have data that is relevant, but it's not immediately clear.","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:25:14.956967-04:00","Yes","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 22:25:14.958147+00:00"

In this study, we use plant macrofossils and analysis of fossil pollen and spores from the Western Desert, Egypt, to assess temporal changes in plant communities during the Cenomanian. The investigated strata have relatively diverse sporomorph assemblages, which reflect the nature of parent vegetation. Specifically, the palynofloras represent ferns, conifers, monosulcate pollen producers, Gnetales, and a diverse group of angiosperms. Comparisons of both, dispersed palynoflora and plant macrofossils reveal different characteristics of the palaeoflora owing to a plethora of taphonomical and ecological biases including the depositional environment, production levels, and discrepancies between different plant organs. A combination of detailed records of sporomorphs, leaves, and charcoal from the studied successions provide new understandings of the palaeoclimate and palaeogeography during the Cenomanian and Albian-Cenomanian transition in Egypt. The mixed composition of the palynofloral assemblages reflects the presence of different depositional situations with a weak marine influence, as evidenced by a minor dinoflagellate cysts component. The local vegetation comprised various categories including herbaceous groups including ferns and eudicots, fluvial, open environments, and xeric arboreal communities dominated by Cheirolepidiaceae and perhaps including drought- and/or salt-tolerating ferns (Anemiaceae) and other gymnosperms (Araucariaceae, Ginkgoales, Cycadales, and Gnetales) as well as angiosperms. The presence of riparian and freshwater wetland communities favouring aquatic and/or hygrophilous ferns (of Salviniaceae and Marsileaceae), is noted. The wide variation of depositional settings derived from the palynological data may be attributed to a prevalent occurrence of producers in local vegetation during the early Cenomanian of Egypt. For the purpose of this work on the studied Bahariya Formation and its equivalent rock units, where iconic dinosaurs and other fossil fauna roamed, we attempt to improve the understanding of Egypt's Cenomanian climate, which is reconstructed as generally warm and humid punctuated by phases of considerably drier conditions of varying duration.","02","2023","01","PLoS One","PloS one","Ecosystem; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Egypt; Spores, Protozoan; Fossils; Tracheophyta; Plants; Magnoliopsida; Ferns","","","","","Maybe Neotoma","No","This article may have data that is relevant, but it's not immediately clear.","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:09:10.349725-04:00","No","","NaT"

"5","Individual bee foragers are less efficient transporters of pollen for the plants from which they collect the most pollen into their scopae.","37163647","10.1002/ajb2.16178","Bees provision most of the pollen they remove from anthers to their larvae and transport only a small proportion to stigmas, which can negatively affect plant fitness. Though most bee species collect pollen from multiple plant species, we know little about how the efficiency of bees' pollen transport varies among host plant species, or how it relates to other aspects of generalist bee foraging behavior that benefit plant fitness, such as specialization on individual foraging bouts. We compared the pollen collected and transported by three bee species for 46 co-occurring plant species. Specifically, we compared the relative abundance of pollen taxa in individual bees' scopae, structures where bees store pollen to provision larvae, with the relative abundance of pollen taxa on the rest of bees' bodies, which is more likely to be transferred to stigmas. Bees carried five times more pollen grains in their scopae than elsewhere on their bodies. Within foraging bouts, bees were relatively specialized in their pollen collection, but transported proportionally less pollen for the host plants on which they specialized. Across foraging bouts, two bee species transported proportionally less pollen for some of their host plants than for others, though differences didn't consistently follow the same trend as at the foraging bout scale. Our results suggest that foraging bout specialization, which is known to reduce heterospecific pollen transfer, also results in less efficient pollen transport. Thus, bee foragers that visit predominantly one plant species may have contrasting effects on that plant's fitness. This article is protected by copyright.

The species often co-flowers with other Linum species using the same pollinators. We investigated whether L. suffruticosum trait variation could be explained by local patterns of pollinator sharing and associated evolution to reduce interspecific pollen transfer. Pollinator observations were made in different localities (single species, co-flowering with other congeners). Floral traits were measured to detect differences across populations and from co-flowering species. Reproductive costs were quantified using interspecific hand-pollinations and measures of pollen-tube formation, combined with observations of pollen arrival on stigmas and pollen tube-formation under natural pollination in allopatric and sympatric localities. The size and identity of the most important pollinator of L. suffruticosum, and whether there was pollinator sharing with co-flowering species, appeared to explain floral trait variation related to pollinator fit. The morphological overlap of the flowers of L. suffruticosum with those of co-flowering species varied, depending on co-flowering species identity. A post-pollination incompatibility system maintains reproductive isolation, but conspecific pollen-tube formation was lower after heterospecific pollination. Under natural pollination at sites of co-flowering with congeners, conspecific pollen-tube formation was lower than at single-species localities. Trait variation in L. suffruticosum appears to respond to the most important local pollinator. Locally, incomplete pollinator partitioning might cause interspecific pollination, imposing reproductive costs. This may generate selection on floral traits for reduced morphological overlap with co-flowering congeners, leading to the evolution of pollination ecotypes. This article is protected by copyright.

Pour plate technique was used to isolate bacteria from honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) pollen samples. Different colonies grown on agar plates were selected and screened for their anti-microbial activity against important pathogens using agar well diffusion assay. The isolates that exhibited remarkable inhibitory effects against all tested pathogens were identified by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil) free radical scavenging assays were used to assess the antioxidant capacity of their postbiotics. Besides, the total phenolic and total flavonoid compounds in postbiotics were determined as gallic acid and quercetin equivalents, respectively. The valuable metabolites in postbiotics were also profiled using chromatographic tools and Mass Spectrophotometry (MS) analysis. Twenty-seven strains were isolated from different honey bee pollen samples. 16 out of the 27 strains exhibited antagonistic activity against at least one reference strain of pathogens, tested. The most effective strains belonging to the genus Weissella were identified as W. cibaria and W. confusa. Postbiotics above 10 mg/mL exhibited higher radical scavenging activity and high total phenolic and total flavonoid contents. MS analysis demonstrated that metabolites in postbiotics derived from Weissella spp. were found very similar to the metabolites found in honeybee pollen. The outcomes of this study revealed that honey bee pollen could be considered a potential source for the bacteria which produce anti-microbial and anti-oxidant agents. The similarity with the nutritional dynamics of honey bee pollen also indicated that postbiotics could also be used as novel and sustainable food supplements.","05","2023","11","J Infect Dev Ctries","Journal of infection in developing countries","Honey bee; Weissella; bio-activity; microbiota; pollen; postbiotics; Bees; Animals; Antioxidants; Weissella; Agar; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Flavonoids; Phenols; Metabolome","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:47:22.179213-04:00","No","","NaT"

In this study, we investigated pollen production of 17 birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) individuals along an altitudinal gradient in the European Alps. We sampled catkins at nine locations in the years 2020-2021 and monitored air temperatures. We investigated how birch pollen, flowers and inflorescences are produced in relation to thermal factors at various elevations. We found that mean pollen production of Betula pubescens Ehrh. varied between 0.4 and 8.3 million pollen grains per catkin. We did not observe any significant relationships between the studied reproductive metrics and altitude.

In order to describe this trophic relationship, we conducted acoustic recordings at five paired sites (willow/control tree) in proximity to known barbastelle hibernation sites (Natura 2000: PLH080003 and PLH200014) beginning in mid-March 2022 after the first willow blossom sighting. Our study confirms a relationship between willow trees and barbastelles during early spring, as their activity around them was significantly higher than control sites. We also explore the activity of barbastelles over time, finding that activity levels around willows significantly decrease from the night of the first recorded bat, while the abundance of non-moth specialist bats remains consistent. Short-time importance (directly after hibernation) of willows for a moth specialist bat is probably due to other species blossom, attracting alternative prey, and in consequence-the bat.

In this study, pollen quality analysis methods were evaluated for their suitability for routine quality control of cryopreserved pollen batches. The assessments, including pollen viability, pollen germinability and pollen vigor analysis, were conducted in two locations on a diverse set of cryopreserved tomato and pepper pollen batches. While the viability obtained by Impedance Flow Cytometry (IFC) can be interpreted as the pollen's potential to germinate, the in vitro germination assay directly quantifies this functionality under given assay conditions. A linear correlation was found between pollen viability obtained by IFC and in vitro germinability. In conclusion, IFC is the most suitable tool for applications and industries requiring a high degree of automation, throughput, repeatability, and reproducibility. In vitro germination assays are suitable for studies within certain temporal and geographic limitations, due to difficulties in standardization. On the other hand, vigor assessments are not sufficiently addressing the needs of the industry due to poor reproducibility and low throughput.","05","2023","08","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","Solanaceae; Reproducibility of Results; Pollen; Pollination; Vegetables; Cryopreservation","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 19:06:17.572294-04:00","No","","NaT"

Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) existing in the insect's olfactory system can recognize environmental semiochemicals. It was known that sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides could still cause a variety of physiological and behavioral abnormalities in bees. However, the molecular mechanism of A. cerana sensing and response for insecticide has not been further investigated. In this study, we found an A. cerana OBP17 gene significantly up-regulated expressed after exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid based on the transcriptomics results. The spatiotemporal expression profiles showed that OBP17 was highly expressed in the legs. Competitive fluorescence binding assays showed that OBP17 had the special and high binding affinity to imidacloprid among the 24 candidate semiochemicals, and the K<sub>A</sub> value of OBP17 binding with imidacloprid reached the maximum (6.94&#xa0;&#xd7;&#xa0;10<sup>4</sup>&#xa0;L/mol) at low-temperature. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the quenching mechanism changed from dynamic to static binding interaction with the increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the force changed from hydrogen bond and van der Waals force to hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic force, indicating the interaction exhibits variability and flexibility. Molecular docking showed that Phe107 contributed the most energy. RNA interference (RNAi) results showed that OBP17 knockdown significantly enhanced the electrophysiological response of the bees' forelegs to imidacloprid. Our study indicated that OBP17 could precisely touch and sense sublethal doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid in the natural environment through its high expression in legs, and the upregulation expression of OBP17 exposure to imidacloprid probably implied that it participate in the detoxification processes of A. cerana.

"18","Beyond P:O ratios: evolutionary consequences of pollinator dependence and pollination efficiency for pollen and ovule production in angiosperms.","37146240","10.1002/ajb2.16177","The relative per-flower production of ovules and pollen varies broadly with angiosperm mating systems, with outcrossing types commonly producing more pollen grains per ovule than selfing types. The evolutionary causes of this variation are contentious, especially the relevance of pollination risk. Resolution of this debate may have been hampered by its focus on pollen:ovule (P:O) ratios rather than on the evolution of pollen and ovule numbers per se. Using published mean ovule and pollen counts, we analyzed associations with the proportion of removed pollen that reaches stigmas (pollen-transfer efficiency) and differences between pollinator-dependent and autogamous forms within and among species. Analyses involved Bayesian methods that simultaneously considered variation in pollen and ovule numbers and accounted for phylogenetic relatedness. We also assessed the utility of P:O ratios as mating-system proxies and their association with female outcrossing rates. Median pollen number declined consistently with pollen-transfer efficiency among species, whereas median ovule number did not. Similarly, in both intraspecific and interspecific analyses, pollinator-dependent plants produced more pollen than autogamous plants, whereas ovule production did not differ statistically. Distributions of P:O ratios overlapped extensively for self-incompatible and self-compatible species and for different mating-system classes, and P:O ratios correlated weakly with outcrossing rate. Our findings demonstrate that pollinator dependence and pollination efficiency commonly influence the evolution of pollen number per flower but have more limited effects on ovule number. P:O ratios provide ambiguous, possibly misleading, information about mating systems, especially when compared among clades. This article is protected by copyright.

Compared to wild-type or SlBG10 overexpressing (SlBG10-OE) lines, knockout of SlBG10 caused pollen arrest and failure to set fruit with reduced male rather than female fecundity. Further analyses showed that SlBG10-knockout promoted callose deposition in anther at the tetrad-to-microspore stages, resulting in pollen abortion and male sterility. Moreover, loss-of-function SlBG10 delayed degradation of endosperm cell wall calloses during cellularization and impeded early seed development. We also uncovered that Botrytis cinerea infection induces SlBG10 expression in wild-type tomato, and the knockout lines showed increased callose accumulation in fruit pericarps, reduced susceptibility to B. cinerea and enhanced antioxidant capacity to maintain tomato fruit quality. However, expression of genes encoding cell wall hydrolases decreased in SlBG10-knockout tomatoes and thus led to an increase in pericarp epidermal thickness, enhancement in fruit firmness, reduction of fruit water loss and extension of tomato shelf life.

Here, we used queens of the common eastern bumble bee, <i>Bombus impatiens</i>, to examine how pollen diets varying in their protein to lipid ratio and total nutrient amounts affected queen performance during and after diapause. We compared diapause survival and reproductive performance post-diapause across different diets and found that queen survival was highest when pollen had a nutritional ratio of approximately 5:1 (protein to lipid). This diet is significantly enriched in proteins compared to the pollen fed to bumble bees in the lab (1:1) or commonly available in agricultural landscapes. Altering the quantity of macronutrients within this ratio did not improve survival or performance. Our results emphasize the importance of adequate nutrition for diapause performance in bees with annual life cycles and the importance of providing annual bees with floral provisioning based on their individual nutritional targets.","05","2023","05","Integr Org Biol","Integrative organismal biology (Oxford, England)","","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:14:10.818614-04:00","No","","NaT"
"23","Research progress on the mechanisms underlying poultry immune regulation by plant polysaccharides.","37138926","10.3389/fvets.2023.1175848","With the rapid development of poultry industry and the highly intensive production management, there are an increasing number of stress factors in poultry production. Excessive stress will affect their growth and development, immune function, and induce immunosuppression, susceptibility to a variety of diseases, and even death. In recent years, increasing interest has focused on natural components extracted from plants, among which plant polysaccharides have been highlighted because of their various biological activities. Plant polysaccharides are natural immunomodulators that can promote the growth of immune organs, activate immune cells and the complement system, and release cytokines. As a green feed additive, plant polysaccharides can not only relieve stress and enhance the immunity and disease resistance of poultry, but also regulate the balance of intestinal microorganisms and effectively alleviate all kinds of stress faced by poultry. This paper reviews the immunomodulatory effects and molecular mechanisms of different plant polysaccharides (<i>Atractylodes macrocephala</i> Koidz polysaccharide, <i>Astragalus</i> polysaccharides, Taishan <i>Pinus massoniana</i> pollen polysaccharide, and alfalfa polysaccharide) in poultry. Current research results reveal that plant polysaccharides have potential uses as therapeutic agents for poultry immune abnormalities and related diseases.","05","2023","05","Front Vet Sci","Frontiers in veterinary science","immune adjuvant; immune regulation; intestinal health; plant polysaccharides; poultry","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:37:55.943704-04:00","No","","NaT"

Their participation in flower development is well-documented, and their presence in pollen raises the question of their role in pollen/pollinator interactions. The structural characterization of phenolamides is complicated by the presence of positional isomers and stereoisomers. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in the positive ionization mode is becoming very popular in phenolamide structural characterization. However, collision-induced transamidation processes that cause the swapping of side chains have been detected, making it difficult to distinguish regioisomers with this technique. In the present report, we explore the dissociation processes undergone by the [M - H]<sup>-</sup> ions of spermidine-based phenolamides as model compounds. We describe two original competitive dissociation routes, namely, the phenolate and imidate pathways, to account for the observed fragmentation reactions undergone by collisional activated standard phenolamide anions. Whereas the phenolate pathway is regioselective at the central position for spermidine, the imidate pathway, requiring a deprotonated amide, only occurs at the extremities. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments on negatively charged phenolamide ions may then outperform their positive ionization mode counterparts for the distinction between phenolamide regioisomers and globally for the identification of phenolamides in natural extracts.","05","2023","03","J Nat Prod","Journal of natural products","","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:48:26.475584-04:00","No","","NaT"

Identifying grass species through standard pollen monitoring techniques have limitations due to challenges in species-specific pollen identification. As a result, these monitoring methods end up grouping all Poaceae species together, even though there are hundreds of grass species in Europe with flowering times that may vary drastically among species. Given this lack of specificity, it is hard to know which grass species are responsible for causing allergies over the pollen season, and how different species are affected by climate change. To address these issues, we obtained phenological data from thousands of herbarium specimens collected across Denmark spanning 190&#x202f;years and used pollen monitoring data collected over the last four decades to determine the response of flowering time to climate change for 12 allergenic grass species, and identified which species are likely the biggest contributors to grass pollen loads throughout the pollen season. We find that pollen season duration is lasting longer and starting earlier, and the maximum pollen loads are occurring earlier in response to warmer temperatures. Herbarium specimens provide taxonomic resolution and reveal that many grass species are flowering earlier in response to warmer spring temperatures. Seven out of the 12 species studied in Denmark are identified as major contributors to airborne pollen based on their flowering times, relative abundance and overlap with the time of the year when maximum pollen loads are detected. Four species (Poa pratensis, Dactylis glomerata, Festuca rubra, Holcus lanatus) significantly shifted their flowering time in response to warming temperatures and are flagged as of particular concern to allergy sufferers. Using data derived from natural history collections can contribute to the advancement of pollen forecasting for asthma and allergy patients under both current conditions and amidst future global changes.","05","2023","01","Sci Total Environ","The Science of the total environment","Allergenic pollen; Climate change; Grass pollen; Herbarium specimens; Phenology; Pollen allergies","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:08:25.796680-04:00","No","","NaT"

Hotter and drier climates lead to longer and more severe wildland fire seasons, impairing air quality around the globe. Hotter temperatures lead to higher levels of ozone, and particles, causing the exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases and premature mortality. Longer pollen seasons and higher pollen levels provoke allergic airway diseases. In arid regions, accelerated land degradation and desertification are promoting dust pollution and impairing food production and nutritional content that are essential to respiratory health. Extreme weather events and flooding impede healthcare delivery and can lead to poor indoor air quality due to mold overgrowth. Climate and human activities that harm the environment and ecosystem may also affect the emergence and spread of viral infections including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and associated morbidity and mortality exacerbated by air pollution. Children and elderly are more susceptible to the adverse health effects of climate change. Geographical and socioeconomic circumstances along with a decreased capacity to adapt, collectively enhance the vulnerability to adverse effects of climate change. Successful mitigation of anthropogenic climate change is dependent on the commitment of energy-intensive nations to manage greenhouse gas emissions, as well as, societal support and response to aggravating factors.

We studied effects of proximity to a mass-flowering crop on the pollination of local co-flowering plants and on patterns of natural selection on a pollination-generalised plant on the Tibetan Plateau. We recorded pollinator visitation rates and community composition at different distances (near vs. far) to oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) fields in two habitat types and quantified pollinator-mediated selection on attractive traits of <i>Trollius ranunculoides</i>. The proximity to oilseed rape increased pollinator visitation in neighbouring alpine meadows and changed pollinator composition in neighbouring shrub meadows. <i>Trollius ranunculoides</i> in the alpine meadow near oilseed rape received three times more pollinator visits (mainly bees) and consequently had a 16.5% increase in seed set but also received slightly more heterospecific pollen per stigma. In contrast, pollinator visitation to <i>T. ranunculoides</i> in the shrub meadow near oilseed rape was three times lower (mainly flies), leading to a 10.7% lower seed despite no effect on pollen deposition. The proximity to the oilseed rape field intensified pollinator-mediated selection on flower size and weakened selection on flower height of <i>T. ranunculoides</i> in the alpine meadow but did not affect phenotypic selection on either trait in the shrub meadow. Our study highlights context-dependent variation in plant-pollinator interactions close to mass-flowering oilseed rape, suggesting potential effects on the evolution of flower traits of native plants through altered pollinator-mediated selection.

Both intrinsic genetic factors, such as susceptibility to type 2 inflammation or skin barrier dysfunction, and extrinsic environmental factors, such as air pollen and skin microbiota, contribute to AD. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, which does not often colonize the skin of healthy individuals, is commonly identified in the lesional skin of patients with AD and is correlated with the disease flare. However, the role of <i>S. aureus</i> in the pathogenesis of AD has not been elucidated. Here, we discuss the pathological behavior of <i>S. aureus</i>, focusing on accessory gene regulator (Agr) quorum sensing, which is a fundamental bacterial cell-to-cell interaction mechanism that affects the behavior of <i>S. aureus</i> and other members of the microbial community. Importantly, beyond bacteria-bacteria interactions, the Agr quorum sensing system also regulates various virulence factors, which induce type 2 and IL-17-dependent skin inflammation in the host. Furthermore, the colonization of Agr-positive <i>S. aureus</i> in early life accelerates the development of pediatric AD. Finally, we aim to highlight the current efforts to establish novel therapeutic methods to ameliorate or prevent AD through Agr-targeted intervention.""","05","2023","02","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology","Agr; IL-17; Staphycoccus aureus; Th2; atopic dermatits; dysbiosis; quorum sensing; Adult; Humans; Child; Dermatitis, Atopic; Staphylococcus aureus; Quorum Sensing; Dysbiosis; Staphylococcus; Inflammation; Staphylococcal Infections; Bacteria","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:39:48.345972-04:00","No","","NaT"

After HT, the pollen fertility was significantly reduced, and abnormal anther structures were observed by the paraffin section. In addition, the metabolomics analysis results showed that a total of 125 differential metabolites were identified after HT, consisting of 99 significantly upregulated and 26 significantly downregulated metabolites. Among these differential metabolites, a total of 26 related metabolic pathways were found, and four pathways showed significant differences, namely, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism; plant hormone signal transduction; amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism; and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. In addition, pollen fertility was decreased by altering the metabolites of plant hormone signal transduction and amino acid and sugar metabolism pathway under HT.

The disease triggers, allergens, are mostly proteins contained in various natural sources such as plant pollen, animal dander, dust mites, foods, fungi, and insect venoms. Allergies can manifest with a wide range of symptoms in various organs and be anything from just tedious to life-threatening. A majority of all allergy patients are self-treated with symptom-relieving medicines, while allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only causative treatment option. This review will aim to give an overview of the state-of-the-art allergy management, including the use of new biologics and the application of biomarkers, and a special emphasis and discussion on current research trends in the field of AIT. Conventional AIT has proven effective, but the years-long treatment compromises patient compliance. Moreover, AIT is typically not offered for food allergies. Hence, there is a need for new, effective, and safe AIT methods. Novel routes of administration (e.g. oral and intralymphatic), hypoallergenic AIT products, and more effective adjuvants hold great promise.

They are also known to interact with several protein complexes: telomerase, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) E(z) subunits and the PEAT complex (PWOs-EPCRs-ARIDs-TRBs). Here we characterize two novel members of the TRB family (TRB4 and TRB5). Our wide phylogenetic analyses have shown that TRB proteins evolved in the plant kingdom after the transition to a terrestrial habitat in Streptophyta, and consequently TRBs diversified in seed plants. TRB4-5 share common TRB motifs while differing in several others and seem to have an earlier phylogenetic origin than TRB1-3. Their common Myb-like domains bind long arrays of telomeric repeats in vitro, and we have determined the minimal recognition motif of all TRBs as one telo-box. Our data indicate that despite the distinct localization patterns of TRB1-3 and TRB4-5 in situ, all members of TRB family mutually interact and also bind to telomerase/PRC2/PEAT complexes.

While the T-DNA insert into GP210 reduced expression of the gene, the insert in the NDC1 gene resulted in increased expression in both the ndc1 mutant as well as the ndc1/gp210 double mutant. The ndc1 and gp210 individual mutants showed little phenotypic difference from wild-type plants, but the ndc1/gp210 mutant showed a range of phenotypic effects. As with many plant nuclear pore protein mutants, these effects included non-nuclear phenotypes such as reduced pollen viability, reduced growth and glabrous leaves in mature plants. Importantly, however, ndc1/gp210 exhibited nuclear-specific effects including modifications to nuclear shape in different cell types. We also observed functional changes to nuclear transport in ndc1/gp210 plants, with low levels of cytoplasmic fluorescence observed in cells expressing nuclear-targeted GFP.

This study aimed to investigate the association between PFAS exposure and immune-mediated diseases such as allergies, eczemas, and autoimmune diseases in a population of adults in the Czech Republic. This study included 309 adults from the Central European Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children: Young Adults (CELSPAC: YA). 12 PFASs were measured in participants' serum by HPLC-MS/MS, 3 PFASs were removed from the subsequent analyses due to low detection frequency. The associations of 9 PFASs with 9 immune-mediated diseases were assessed by logistic regression. Furthermore, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was used to estimate the effect of the PFAS mixture on immune-mediated diseases. All analyses were adjusted for sex, age, BMI, smoking, education, and family history of immune-mediated diseases. In cases of a statistically significant interaction of PFASs and sex, stratified analyses were performed for men and women. Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were negatively associated with both atopic eczema (OR per IQR increase 0.58 (95% CI 0.37-0.90) for PFOA and 0.56 (0.32-0.95) for PFOS) and contact dermatitis (0.37 (0.16-0.85) for PFOA and 0.33 (0.11-0.94) for PFOS).

We identified, 927 cis-regulated and 383 trans-regulated target genes of the lincRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of the target genes revealed that these genes were specifically enriched in pathways like pollen and pollen tube development, oxidative phosphorylation, etc. We detected 23 lincRNAs that were co-expressed with 17 pollen-related genes with known functions. Fifty-nine lincRNAs were predicted to be endogenous target mimics (eTMs) for 25 miRNAs, and found to be associated with pollen development.

This characteristic has wide-ranging impacts on commercial growing, harvesting, and breeding. However, mutations in S-alleles as well as changes in the expression of M locus-encoded glutathione-S-transferase (MGST) can lead to complete or partial self-compatibility, simplifying orchard management and reducing possible crop losses. Knowledge of S-alleles is important for growers and breeders, but current determination methods are challenging, requiring several PCR runs. Here we present a system for the identification of multiple S-alleles and MGST promoter variants in one-tube PCR, with subsequent fragment analysis on a capillary genetic analyzer. The assay was shown to unequivocally determine three MGST alleles, 14 self-incompatible S-alleles, and all three known self-compatible S-alleles (S3', S4', S5') in 55 combinations tested, and thus it is especially suitable for routine S-allele diagnostics and molecular marker-assisted breeding for self-compatible sweet cherries. In addition, we identified a previously unknown S-allele in the 'Techlovicka&#xb4; genotype (S54) and a new variant of the MGST promoter with an 8-bp deletion in the &#xb4;Kronio&#xb4; cultivar.","05","2023","01","Int J Mol Sci","International journal of molecular sciences","M locus-encoded glutathione-S-transferase; MAS; MGST; S-allele; fragment analysis; molecular marker assisted breeding; self-compatibility; self-incompatibility; sweet cherry; Prunus avium; Alleles; Prunus; Plant Breeding; Polymerase Chain Reaction","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:44:07.402712-04:00","No","","NaT"

Here, we explored the medicinal effects of different pollen on <i>Bombus terrestris</i> workers infected by the gut parasite <i>Crithidia bombi</i>. First, we used a forced-feeding experimental design allowing for the distinction between prophylactic and therapeutic effects of pollen, considering host tolerance and resistance. Then, we assessed whether bumble bees favoured medicating resources when infected to demonstrate potential self-medicative behaviour. We found that infected bumble bees had a lower fitness but higher resistance when forced to consume sunflower or heather pollen, and that infection dynamics was more gradual in therapeutic treatments. When given the choice between resources, infected workers did not target medicating pollen, nor did they consume more medicating pollen than uninfected ones. These results emphasize that the access to medicating resources could impede parasite dynamics, but that the cost-benefit trade-off could be detrimental when fitness is highly reduced.","04","2023","30","Biology (Basel)","Biology","environmental stressors; prophylaxis; resistance; self-medication; therapy; tolerance","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:45:14.805904-04:00","No","","NaT"

Therefore, we evaluated the association between cord blood TARC (cTARC) and the development of allergic diseases in childhood. This is a high-risk birth cohort for allergy, consisting of children with a family history of allergy. We collected 263 pairs of maternal and child cord blood samples perinatally and child blood samples at ages 1, 2, and 5 years.

Here we explore the behavioral and physiological effects of the attractants isopentyl acetate and pollen patty upon A. tumida adults, and also investigate the mixture of attractants with repellent compounds, which were previously untested against A. tumida. Electroantennograms established sensitivity of A. tumida antennae to both attractants and all repellents with the exception of DEET, with antennae displaying greatest sensitivity to the repellent pyrrolidine. A walking-response olfactometer, designed specifically for A. tumida, was used for all behavioral experiments. It was found that both pollen patty and isopentyl acetate were attractive to A. tumida adults; conversely, mixes of attractants and repellent volatiles led to less attraction or avoidance of what was previously a significantly attractive source. Of all repellents tested, pyrrolidine was found to be the most repelling molecule, with significant avoidance of the attractive source at a 10&#xa0;mg treatment of pyrrolidine. The results of this study indicate that, at the behavioral level, the repellent compounds pyrrolidine and 1,4-dimethylpiperazine resulted in a negative preference index indicating a repellent behavioral response.

We used cyanogenic glycosides (CNglycs)-constitutive secondary metabolites that deter herbivores by releasing hydrogen cyanide, but also play other metabolic roles-to ask whether more apparent floral tissues and those most important for fitness are more defended as predicted by optimal defence theories, and what fine-scale CNglyc localisation reveals about function(s)? Florets of eleven species from the Proteaceae family were dissected to quantitatively compare the distribution of CNglycs within flowers and investigate whether distributions vary with other floral/plant traits. CNglycs were identified and their localisation in florets was revealed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). We identified extremely high CNglyc content in floral tissues of several species (&gt;1% CN), highly tissue-specific CNglyc distributions within florets, and substantial interspecific differences in content distributions, not all consistent with optimal defence hypotheses. Four patterns of within-flower CNglyc allocation were identified: greater tissue-specific allocations to (1) anthers, (2) pedicel (and gynophore), (3) pollen presenter, and (4) a more even distribution among tissues with higher content in pistils. Allocation patterns were not correlated with other floral traits (e.g. colour) or taxonomic relatedness. MALDI-MSI identified differential localisation of two tyrosine-derived CNglycs, demonstrating the importance of visualising metabolite localisation, with the diglycoside proteacin in vascular tissues, and monoglycoside dhurrin across floral tissues. High CNglyc content, and diverse, specific within-flower localisations indicate allocations are adaptive, highlighting the importance of further research into the ecological and metabolic roles of floral CNglycs.","05","2023","01","PLoS One","PloS one","Proteaceae; Flowers; Glycosides; Pollen; Plants; Pollination","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:48:18.970996-04:00","No","","NaT"

Auxin Response Factor (ARF) genes encode auxin-responsive transcription factors, which are involved in the regulation of diverse morphogenetic processes, including flowering and seed development. However, limited information on the ARF gene family in the Orchidaceae is available. In this study, 112 ARF genes were identified in the genomes of 5 orchid species (Apostasia shenzhenica, Dendrobium catenatum, Phalaenopsis aphrodite, Phalaenopsis equestris and Vanilla planifolia,). These genes were grouped into 7 subfamilies based on their phylogenetic relationships. Compared with the ARF family in model plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, one group of ARF genes involved in pollen wall synthesis has been lost during evolution of the Orchidaceae. This loss corresponds with absence of the exine in the pollinia. Through mining of the published genomic and transcriptomic data for the 5 orchid species: the ARF genes of subfamily 4 may play an important role in flower formation and plant growth, whereas those of subfamily 3 are potentially involved in pollen wall development. the study results provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of unique morphogenetic phenomena of orchids, which lay a foundation for further analysis of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of sexual reproduction-related genes in orchids.","05","2023","10","Plant Mol Biol","Plant molecular biology","ARF; Auxin response factor; Genome-wide identification; Orchidaceae; Transcriptome; Orchidaceae; Transcriptome; Phylogeny; Plant Breeding; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Flowers; Plant Proteins","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:54:14.460262-04:00","No","","NaT"

We assessed the potential of six brassicaceous plants (replicated plots grown in the field) to enhance populations of parasitoids of OSR pests whilst minimising proliferation of their pest hosts. Fodder radish (<i>Raphanus sativus</i>) facilitated high production of parasitoids of the pollen beetle pest (<i>Brassicogethes aeneus</i>) but may proliferate <i>Ceutorhynchus</i> weevil pests due to low parasitism. Turnip rape (<i>B. rapa</i>) and the <i>B. rapa</i> hybrid 'Tyfon' showed potential to perform a trap cropping function for pests, but their early flowering phenology resulted in <i>B. aeneus</i> larvae escaping parasitisation, potentially assisting proliferation of this pest. Forage rape <i>B. napus</i> exhibited similarly high <i>B. aeneus</i> parasitoid production characteristics to <i>R. sativus</i> but did not potentiate problems with other pests, indicating that it would be a favourable banker plant option.

The niche modelling was based on presence-only records of Limodorum abortivum, two species of Russula and three insects pollinating orchid (Anthophora affinis, Bombus terrestris, Rhodanthidium septemdentatum). Two sets of orchid predictions were examined-the first one included only climatic data and the second one was based on climate data and data on future distribution of orchid fungal symbionts. Overall, a poleward range shift is predicted to occur as a result of climate change and apparently global warming will be favorable for L. abortivum and its potential geographical range will expand. However, due to the negative effect of global warming on fungal symbionts of L. abortivum, the actual extension of the suitable niches of the orchid will be much limited. Considering future possibility of cross-pollination, the availability of A. affinis for L. abortivum will decrease and this bee will be available in the worst case scenarios only for 21% of orchid populations.

Self-incompatibility (SI) in Brassicaceae is regulated by the self-recognition mechanism, which is based on the S-haplotype-specific direct interaction of the pollen-derived ligand, SP11/SCR, and the stigma-side receptor, SRK. M locus protein kinase (MLPK) is known to be one of the positive effectors of the SI response. MLPK directly interacts with SRK, and is phosphorylated by SRK in Brassica rapa. In Brassicaceae, MLPK was demonstrated to be essential for SI in B. rapa and Brassica napus, whereas it is not essential for SI in Arabidopsis thaliana (with introduced SRK and SP11/SCR from related SI species). Little is known about what determines the need for MLPK in SI of Brassicaceae. In this study, we investigated the relationship between S-haplotype diversity and MLPK function by analyzing the SI phenotypes of different S haplotypes in a mlpk/mlpk mutant background.

In insect-pollinated plants, competition to attract pollinators is expected to result in pollinator-mediated selection on attractive floral traits. This could overlap with sexual selection if the number of mating partners increases with pollinator attraction, resulting in an improved reproductive success. In this study, we measured a set of floral traits and estimated individual fitness in male and female Silene dioica in an experimental population. Results align with the predictions of Bateman's principles, in the absence of pollen limitation. In females, natural selection acted on traits that are typically linked with fertility (number of flowers and number of gametes), and selection strength was similar in open- and hand-pollinated females, suggesting a limited role of pollinator-mediated selection. In males, flowering duration and corolla width were positively associated with both reproductive success and number of mates, suggesting that sexual selection has played a role in the evolution of these traits. The use of Bateman's metrics further confirmed stronger sexual selection in males than in females. Taken together, our results shed light on the occurrence of sex-specific patterns of selection in an insect-pollinated plant population.","04","2023","24","Evolution","Evolution; international journal of organic evolution","Bateman gradient; fertility selection; floral traits; mating success; paternity analyses; pollinator-mediated selection","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:47:44.083564-04:00","No","","NaT"

Although many elements of grass pollen production and dispersal are quite well researched, gaps still remain around the grass species that are predominant in the air and which of those are most likely to trigger allergy. In this comprehensive review we isolate the species aspect in grass pollen allergy by exploring the interdisciplinary interdependencies between plant ecology, public health, aerobiology, reproductive phenology and molecular ecology. We further identify current research gaps and provide open ended questions and recommendations for future research in an effort to focus the research community to develop novel strategies to combat grass pollen allergy. We emphasise the role of separating temperate and subtropical grasses, identified through divergence in evolutionary history, climate adaptations and flowering times. However, allergen cross-reactivity and the degree of IgE connectivity in sufferers between the two groups remains an area of active research. The importance of future research to identify allergen homology through biomolecular similarity and the connection to species taxonomy and practical implications of this to allergenicity is further emphasised. We also discuss the relevance of eDNA and molecular ecological techniques (DNA metabarcoding, qPCR and ELISA) as important tools in quantifying the connection between the biosphere with the atmosphere. By gaining more understanding of the connection between species-specific atmospheric eDNA and flowering phenology we will further elucidate the importance of species in releasing grass pollen and allergens to the atmosphere and their individual role in grass pollen allergy.","04","2023","30","Sci Total Environ","The Science of the total environment","Aerobiology; Allergens; Bioaerosols; Flowering; Poaceae; eDNA","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 19:06:57.894024-04:00","No","","NaT"

ZmSWEET1b is a canonical sugar transporter, characteristic of seven transmembrane helices and plasma membrane localization. ZmSWEET1b and its rice ortholog OsSWEET1b in phylogenetic clade I underwent convergent selection during evolution. Two independent knockout lines were created by the CRISPR/Cas9 method to functionally characterized ZmSWEET1b. Sucrose and fructose contents are significantly decreased in ZmSWEET1b knockout lines. Mature leaves of ZmSWEET1b-edited lines exhibit chlorosis, reminiscent of senescence-like phenotype. Ears and seeds of ZmSWEET1b knockout lines are small.

The adult and larval diet and habitat needs are well known for many bee taxa, but poorly understood for other pollinating taxa. Non-bee pollinators often feed on different substrates in their larval and adult life stages and this diet and habitat diversity has important implications for their conservation and management. We reviewed the global literature on crop pollinating Diptera (the true flies) to identify both larval and adult fly diet and habitat needs. We then assembled the published larval and adult diet and habitat needs of beneficial fly pollinators found globally into a freely accessible database. Of the 405 fly species known to visit global food crops, we found relevant published evidence regarding larval and adult diet and habitat information for 254 species, which inhabited all eight global biogeographic regions. We found the larvae of these species lived in 35 different natural habitats and belong to 10 different feeding guilds. Additionally, differences between adult Diptera sexes also impacted diet needs; females from 14 species across five families fed on protein sources other than pollen to start the reproductive process of oogenesis (egg development) while males of the same species fed exclusively on pollen and nectar. While all adult species fed at least partially on floral nectar and/or pollen, only five species were recorded feeding on pollen and no fly larvae fed on nectar. Of the 242 species of larvae with established diet information, 33% were predators (n =&#x2009;79) and 30% were detritivores (n =&#x2009;73). Detritivores were the most generalist taxa and utilized 17 different habitats and 12 different feeding substrates. Of all fly taxa, only 2% belonged to the same feeding guild in both active life stages. Our results show that many floral management schemes may be insufficient to support pollinating Diptera.

Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that loss of CAP1 results in defects in seed germination and seedling morphology, with some seedlings exhibiting one or three cotyledons. The cap1-1 mutant took longer than the wild type to complete its life cycle, but its flowering time was normal, indicating that loss of CAP1 prolongs reproductive but not vegetative growth. Moreover, loss of CAP1 severely reduces seed production in self-pollinated plants, due to disruption of pollen tube elongation. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that CAP1 may be involved in osmotic stress responses. Indeed, the cap1-1 mutant showed increased tolerance of salt and mannitol treatment, indicating that CAP1 plays a negative role in osmotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.

While predictions based on floral syndrome traits are extremely useful, direct observation can reveal further details of a species' pollination biology. The wildflower Phlox drummondii has a floral syndrome consistent with pollination by Lepidoptera. We tested this prediction using empirical data. We observed each step of pollination in P. drummondii. First, we observed 55.5&#x2009;h of floral visitation across the species range. We used temporal pollinator exclusion to determine the contribution of diurnal and nocturnal pollination to reproductive output. We then quantified P. drummondii pollen transfer by the dominant floral visitor, Battus philenor. Finally, we tested the effect of B. philenor visitation on P. drummondii reproduction by quantifying fruit set following single pollinator visits. Battus philenor is the primary pollinator of P. drummondii. Pollination is largely diurnal, and we observed a variety of lepidopteran visitors during the diurnal period. However, B. philenor was the most frequent visitor, representing 88.5% of all observed visits. Our results show that B. philenor is an extremely common visitor and also an effective pollinator by demonstrating that individuals transfer pollen between flowers and that a single visit can elicit fruit set. Our data are consistent with the prediction of lepidopteran pollination and further reveal a single butterfly species, B. philenor, as the primary pollinator.

Most non-Apis bees are solitary and build their nests in the ground or in tree holes. Therefore, insecticide exposure pathways would differ from those of honeybees and bumblebees. We analyzed the residues of 20 insecticides in Osmia cornifrons bees and their pollen-provisions and nesting materials, along with adult honeybees, soil, and wildflowers collected in four apple orchards in two regions in Japan. Few insecticides were common among adult bees, pollen-provisions, and wildflowers. Insecticides applied in orchards were detected at high frequency: chlorantraniliprole, flubendiamide, and diazinon were detected in almost all samples. Insecticides without a known history of application were detected from various samples at frequencies ranging in 0% to 100%. Even in orchards without a known history of insecticide application, clothianidin was detected in many sample types and at high concentration. A purple deadnettle sample had the highest concentration at 17.5 mg/kg. These results highlight the complexity of pathways of insecticide exposure to O. cornifrons in the environment, as insecticides may remain in the environment for long periods and wild bees may forage farther than previously known distance. Furthermore, each sample type contained different insecticides, so wild bees may have been exposed to different insecticides at different life stages.

However, such applications typically require large cell populations and skilled professionals. Additionally, these methods are unsuitable for sequential analysis before and after cell isolation. In this study, we propose a method for target cell isolation using automated infrared laser-mediated disruption of pollen grains in pollen populations. Germination of the target pollen was observed at the same location as that before laser irradiation, and germinated pollen grains were enriched in the cell population. Pollination of laser-irradiated bulk pollen populations also showed that the target pollen preferentially germinated on the stigma.

"82","RNA-seq analysis of synchronized developing pollen isolated from a single anther.","37077645","10.3389/fpls.2023.1121570","Pollen development, from unicellular microspores to anthesis, is a complex process involving the coordinated specification, differentiation and functions of different cell types. Key to understanding this development is identifying the genes expressed at precise stages of development. However, transcriptomic studies on pollen prior to anthesis are complicated by the inaccessible nature of pollen developing in the anther and the resistant pollen wall. To assist with understanding gene expression during pollen development we have developed a protocol to perform RNA-Seq on pollen isolated from a single anther (SA RNA-Seq). The protocol involves removing pollen from a single anther for analysis and viewing the remaining pollen to determine the developmental stage. The isolated pollen is chemically lysed and mRNA isolated from the lysate using an oligo-dT column before library preparation. Here, we report on the development and testing of our method and the generation of a transcriptome for three stages of pollen development from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and two stages from male kiwifruit (<i>Actinidia chinensis</i>). This protocol enables the transcriptome of precise developmental stages of pollen to be analyzed, and uses a small number of plants, potentially facilitating studies that require a range of treatments or the analysis of the first generation of transgenic plants.","04","2023","21","Front Plant Sci","Frontiers in plant science","RNA-sequencing; lysis; microspore; pollen; transcriptome","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:48:09.596894-04:00","No","","NaT"

We discuss the consequences of respiratory events from birth until old age regarding climate change related alterations in air quality due to pollution caused by increased ozone, pollen, wildfires and fuel combustion as well as the increasing presence of microplastic and microfibres. Early life events such as the effect of hyperoxia in the context of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and crucial effects of the intrauterine environment in the context of pre-eclampsia were discussed. The Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) was put forward as a new point of reference for healthy human lungs. The combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial data in the HLCA has enabled the discovery of new cell types/states and niches, and served as a platform that facilitates further investigation of mechanistic perturbations. The role of cell death modalities in regulating the onset and progression of chronic lung diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target was also discussed. Translational studies identified novel therapeutic targets and immunoregulatory mechanisms in asthma. Lastly, it was highlighted that the choice of regenerative therapy depends on disease severity, ranging from transplantation to cell therapies and regenerative pharmacology.","04","2023","21","ERJ Open Res","ERJ open research","","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:57:24.002226-04:00","No","","NaT"

Yet, the effects of mycorrhizae on pollinator behavior and plant reproduction are unknown for most species, and whether the source or type of mycorrhizal fungi affects reproductive success has rarely been examined. We examined whether inoculating highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum; Ericaceae) with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi enhanced investment in flowering and attractiveness to pollinators, and thus reduced their levels of pollen limitation over that of non-inoculated plants. We also examined the degree to which pollen limitation was dependent on inoculation source and the surrounding pollinator community context. Three-year-old saplings of Vaccinium corymbosum 'Bluecrop' or highbush blueberry (Ericaceae) were inoculated with a) ericoid mycorrhizal fungi within soil of the rhizosphere of plants growing at a local blueberry farm, b) a commercially available ericoid inoculant, c) both the local soils and commercial inoculum, or d) were not inoculated and served as controls. They were grown for one year in pots in a common garden and, in the following year, were moved to six farms in central Vermont that were known from prior studies to differ in pollinator abundance and diversity. We conducted a hand pollination experiment at each farm to examine if inoculation or pollinator abundance (i.e., farm context) affected reproductive success. Plants treated with all types of inoculums were more likely to flower, and produced more inflorescence buds than non-inoculated plants in 2018. However, in 2019, plants in the combination inoculum treatment, alone, produced more inflorescence buds than those in the other treatments. Neither the source of inoculum nor hand pollination affected fruit set (the proportion of flowers setting fruit), or fruit sugar content. Hand pollination, but not inoculation, increased berry mass and the average number of seeds produced/berry. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that mycorrhizal fungi can affect reproductive traits of their hosts but that the effects of mycorrhizal fungi depend on the mycorrhizal symbionts.","04","2023","21","PLoS One","PloS one","Animals; Mycorrhizae; Blueberry Plants; Reproduction; Pollination; Symbiosis; Ericaceae; Soil; Plants","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:41:08.965494-04:00","No","","NaT"

The Iranian Plateau has been considered as one of the last glaciation refugia and a centre of origin and domestication for the common walnut. However, a prerequisite to conserve or utilize the genetic resources of J. regia in the plateau is a comprehensive evaluation of the genetic diversity that is conspicuously lacking. In this regard, we used 31 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to delineate the genetic variation and population structure of 508&#xa0;J.&#xa0;regia individuals among 27 populations from the Iranian Plateau. The SSR markers expressed a high level of genetic diversity (H<sub>O</sub> = 0.438, and H<sub>E</sub> = 0.437). Genetic differentiation among the populations was moderate (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.124), and genetic variation within the populations (79%) significantly surpassed among populations (21%). The gene flow (N<sub>m</sub> = 1.840) may have remarkably influenced the population genetic structure of J. regia, which can be attributed to anthropological activities and wind dispersal of pollen. The STRUCTURE analysis divided the 27 populations into two main clusters. Comparing the neighbor-joining and principal coordinate analysis dendrograms and the Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis revealed the general agreement between the population subdivisions and the genetic relationships among the populations. However, a few geographically close populations dispersed into different clusters. Further, the low genetic diversity of the Sulaymaniyah (SMR) population&#xa0;of Iraq necessitates urgent conservation by propagation and seedling management or tissue culture methods; additionally, we recommend the indispensable preservation of the&#xa0;Gonabad (RGR) and Arak (AKR) populations in Iran. These results reflected consistent high geographical affinity of the accession across the plateau. Our findings suggest that gene flow is a driving factor influencing the genetic structure of J. regia populations, whereas ecological and geological variables did not act as strong barriers. Moreover, the data reported herein provide new insights into the population structure of J. regia germplasm, which will help conserve genetic resources for the future, hence improving walnut breeding programs' efficiency.","04","2023","20","BMC Plant Biol","BMC plant biology","Common walnut; Genetic variation; Germplasm conservation; Iranian Plateau; Persian walnut; Population structure; Refugia; Juglans; Nuts; Iran; Bayes Theorem; Plant Breeding; Genetic Variation","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:15:10.933220-04:00","No","","NaT"
"87","Perception, regulation, and fitness effects of pollen phytosterols in the bumble bee, Bombus terrestris.","37071779","10.1002/ajb2.16165","Many flowering plants depend on insects for pollination and thus attract pollinators by offering rewards, mostly nectar and pollen. Bee pollinators rely on pollen as their main nutrient source. Pollen provides all essential micro- and macronutrients including substances that cannot be synthesized by bees themselves, such as sterols, which bees need for processes such as hormone production. Variations in sterol concentrations may consequently affect bee health and reproductive fitness. We therefore hypothesized that (1) these variations in pollen sterols affect longevity and reproduction in bumble bees and (2) can thus be perceived via the bees' antennae before consumption. We studied the effect of sterols on longevity and reproduction of Bombus terrestris workers in feeding experiments and investigated sterol perception using chemotactile proboscis extension response (PER) conditioning. Workers could perceive several sterols (cholesterol, cholestenone, desmosterol, stigmasterol, &#x3b2;-sitosterol) via their antennae but not differentiate between them. However, when sterols were presented in pollen, and not as a single compound, the bees were unable to differentiate between pollen differing in sterol content. Additionally, different sterol concentrations in pollen neither affected pollen consumption nor brood development or worker longevity. Since we used both natural concentrations and concentrations higher than those found in pollen, our results indicate that bumble bees may not need to pay specific attention to pollen sterol content beyond a specific threshold. Naturally encountered concentrations might fully support their sterol requirements and higher concentrations do not seem to have negative effects.","04","2023","18","Am J Bot","American journal of botany","Bombus terrestris; PER; feeding assay; microcolonies; nutrition; perception; phytosterols; proboscis extension response conditioning","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:20:57.902922-04:00","No","","NaT"

However, several questions about this method remain unresolved, including the extent to which sequence read data is quantitative, which type of sequence count removal threshold to use and how that choice affects our ability to detect rare flower visits, and how sequence artefacts may confound conclusions about bee foraging behavior. To address these questions, we isolated pollen from five plant species and created treatments comprised of pollen from each species alone and combinations of pollen from multiple species that varied in richness and evenness. We used ITS2 and rbcL metabarcoding to identify plant species in the samples, compared the proportion of pollen by mass to the proportion of sequencing reads for each plant species in each treatment, and analyzed the sequencing data using both liberal and conservative thresholds. We collected pollen from foraging bees, analyzed metabarcoding data from those samples using each threshold, and compared the differences in the pollinator networks constructed from the data. Regardless of the threshold used, the relationship between the proportion of pollen by mass and sequencing reads was inconsistent, suggesting that the number of sequence reads is a poor proxy for pollen abundance in mixed-species samples. Using a liberal threshold resulted in greater detection of original plant species in mixtures but also detected additional species in mixtures and single-species samples. The conservative threshold reduced the number of additional plant species detected, but several species in mixtures were not detected above the threshold, resulting in false negatives. Pollinator networks produced using the two thresholds differed and illustrated tradeoffs between detection of rare species and estimation of network complexity. Threshold selection can have a major effect on conclusions drawn from studies using metabarcoding of bee pollen to study plant-pollinator interactions.","04","2023","20","PLoS One","PloS one","Bees; Animals; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Pollen; Plants; Ecology; Pollination","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:37:58.700097-04:00","No","","NaT"

Most studies have compared antagonistic plant-herbivore interactions of domesticated plants and their wild relatives, but little attention has been given to how domestication influences plant-pollinator interactions. Floral attributes and interactions of floral visitors were compared between sister taxa of the genus Cucurbita (Cucurbitaceae), the domesticated C. moschata, C. argyrosperma ssp. argyrosperma and its wild progenitor C. argyrosperma ssp. sororia in the place of origin. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to compare floral morphological traits and analyzed floral reward (nectar and pollen) quantity and quality between flowers of wild and domesticated cucurbits. Staminate and pistillate flowers of all three taxa were video recorded, and visitation and behavior of floral visitors were registered and analyzed. Most floral morphological characteristics of flowers of domesticated taxa were larger in both staminate and pistillate flowers. Staminate and pistillate flowers presented distinct correlations between floral traits and integration indices between domesticated and wild cucurbits. Additionally, pollen quantity and protein to lipid ratio were greater in domesticated cucurbits. Cucurbit pollen specialists, Eucera sp., had the highest probability of visit for all cucurbit taxa. We provide evidence that floral traits of domesticated and wild cucurbit plants experienced different selection pressures. Domesticated cucurbit plants may have more resources invested towards floral traits, thereby increasing attractiveness to pollinators and potentially plant reproductive success.

Different parts of the date tree have been extensively studied for their nutritional and therapeutic properties. Despite an array of publications on the date tree, there has been no attempt to compile in a single study the traditional uses, nutritive value, phytochemical profile, the medicinal properties as well as the potential of the different plant parts as a functional food. Therefore, this review endeavors to systematically review the scientific literature to highlight the traditional uses of date fruit and parts around the world, the nutritional profile of several parts and the medicinal properties. A total of 215 studies was retrieved (traditional uses (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26), nutritional (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;52), and medicinal (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;84)).

Palm leaves showed anti-hyperglycemic effects <i>via</i> inhibition of &#x3b1;-amylase and &#x3b1;-glucosidase. Unlike previous studies, this study highlighted the functional roles of all the plant parts of the palm tree and provided insights into the various mechanism of action of their bioactive compounds. Although scientific shreds of evidence have been growing over the years, there is still a dearth of studies concerning the clinical validation of the date fruit and other plant parts to provide strong evidence on their medicinal uses.

'Moderate' (58% to 80%)- and 'high' (&gt;&#x2009;80%)-Gh-miR167 diminution mimic lines showed dosage-dependent developmental deformities in anther development, pollen maturation, and fruit (=&#x2009;boll) formation. Cross pollination of 'moderate'&#xa0;35S-MIM167 mimic&#xa0;lines with wild type (WT) plant partially restored boll formation and emergence of fiber initials on the ovule surface.

Similarly, accumulative effect of percent Gh-miR167 diminution, cross regulation of its target ARF6/8 genes, and temporal mis-expression of hormone signaling- and flavonoid biosynthesis-associated regulatory miRNAs at early fiber initiation stage caused irregular fiber formation. Spatial and temporal transcription proportions of regulatory miRNAs were also found crucial for the execution of hormone- and flavonoid-dependent progression of floral and fiber development.

Due to its low cost, date palm pollen crushed with its spadix is more widely commercialized and used in Morocco than pure date palm pollen free of spadix. Thus, this study aimed to assess the physicochemical and phytochemical parameters, biological activities, and nutritional value of the two pollen types: Pure date palm pollen and date palm pollen crushed with its spadix. Various physicochemical parameters were determined, including humidity, water activity (<i>a</i><sub>w</sub>), total soluble solids, ash content, and color parameters (<i>L*</i>, <i>a*</i>, <i>b*</i>, <i>C*<sub>ab</sub></i>, and <i>h<sub>ab</sub></i>). Additionally, the phenolic compound profiles were analyzed, and the <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory, and antidiabetic activities were assessed for both pure date palm pollen and date palm pollen crushed with its spadix. Furthermore, the nutritional value was evaluated by determining protein and carbohydrate contents, and mineral and fatty acid profiles. The results have revealed that pure date palm pollen had higher humidity, a<sub>w</sub>, <i>L*</i>, and <i>h<sub>ab</sub></i> color parameters than date palm pollen crushed with its spadix, but lower total soluble solid and ash contents. The main phenolic compounds in pure date palm pollen were ellagic acid, rutin, fisetin, and quercetin, whereas date palm pollen crushed with its spadix contained mainly catechin, chlorogenic acid, <i>p</i>-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and rutin. Moreover, pure date palm pollen showed greater <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant activity, while date palm pollen crushed with its spadix had higher enzyme inhibitory and antidiabetic activities.

In conclusion, although date palm pollen crushed with its spadix is the most widely consumed type, its nutritional value is lower than that of pure date palm pollen. Thus, pure date palm pollen could potentially serve as a better source of many bioactive compounds, making it a viable supplement for various health applications.","04","2023","17","Food Sci Technol Int","Food science and technology international = Ciencia y tecnologia de los alimentos internacional","Phoenix dactylifera L.; bioactive compounds; biological activities; nutritional value; physicochemical parameters; pollen","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:08:17.390859-04:00","No","","NaT"

Here, we demonstrated that miR156b-GmSPL2b module involved in male fertility regulation of soybean cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS)-based restorer line under HT stress. Overexpression of miR156b decreased male fertility in soybean CMS-based restorer line and its hybrid F<sub>1</sub> with CMS line under HT stress. RNA-seq analysis found that miR156b mediated male fertility regulation in soybean under HT stress by regulating the expression of pollen development and HT response related genes. Metabolomic analysis of miR156bOE revealed reduction in flavonoid content under HT stress. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis showed that the overexpression of miR156b caused flavonoid metabolism disorder in soybean flower bud under HT stress. Knockout of GmSPL2b also decreased the thermotolerance of soybean CMS-based restorer line during flowering. Moreover, GmSPL2b turned out to be directly bounded to the promoter of GmHSFA6b. Further verification indicated that GmHSFA6b overexpression enhanced HT tolerance in Arabidopsis during flowering. Substance content and gene expression analysis revealed that miR156b-GmSPL2b may mediate reactive oxygen species clearance by regulating flavonoid metabolism, thus participating in the regulation of male fertility in soybean under HT stress. This study not only provided important progress for understanding the molecular mechanism of miR156b-GmSPL2b regulating the male fertility of soybean CMS-based restorer line under HT stress, but also provided genetic resources and theoretical basis for creating HT-tolerant strong restorer lines.","04","2023","14","Plant Biotechnol J","Plant biotechnology journal","GmHSFA6b; GmSPL2b; high-temperature stress; male fertility; miR156b; soybean (Glycine max)","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:43:18.747914-04:00","No","","NaT"

However, avoiding animal-based foods restricts the diet and is associated with risks, the extent and medical implications of which are at present not sufficiently understood. Elimination diets represent the usual therapeutic long-term management in the presence of food allergy. In order to understand the risks of vegan diets and to discuss these critically from the perspective of food allergies, the expertise of a nutritionist/dietitian with expertise in this area is indispensable. This position paper deals with the incentives behind and the benefits of a plant-based diet. The knowledge required to cover macro- and micronutrient dietary requirements is presented. Using the avoidance of cow's milk as an example, the challenges of adequately meeting nutritional needs are identified and (so-called) milk alternatives are evaluated from an allergy and nutritional point of view. Finally, other plant-based (substitute) products are evaluated from the same perspective, as significant protein sources in vegan diets (e.g., legumes, nuts, and seeds) are at the same time potential and potent triggers of allergic reactions. However, the allergic potential of many substitute products cannot be fully assessed at present due to gaps in research. Wheat as the most important trigger for anaphylaxis in adults is also evaluated. Finally, the increase in ultra-processed products in the (vegan) food sector and their potential consequences for the immune system are discussed.","04","2023","15","Allergol Select","Allergologie select","allergy; assessment of critical needs; food allergy; ultra-processed foods ; vegan diet","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:42:58.144690-04:00","No","","NaT"
"101","Differential ability of three bee species to move genes via pollen.","37053245","10.1371/journal.pone.0271780","Since the release of genetically engineered (GE) crops, there has been increased concern about the introduction of GE genes into non-GE fields of a crop and their spread to feral or wild cross-compatible relatives. More recently, attention has been given to the differential impact of distinct pollinators on gene flow, with the goal of developing isolation distances associated with specific managed pollinators. To examine the differential impact of bee species on gene movement, we quantified the relationship between the probability of getting a GE seed in a pod, and the order in which a flower was visited, or the cumulative distance traveled by a bee in a foraging bout. We refer to these relationships as 'seed curves' and compare these seeds curves among three bee species. The experiments used Medicago sativa L. plants carrying three copies of the glyphosate resistance (GR) allele as pollen donors (M. sativa is a tetraploid), such that each pollen grain carried the GR allele, and conventional plants as pollen recipients. Different foraging metrics, including the number of GR seeds produced over a foraging bout, were also quantified and contrasted among bee species. The lowest number of GR seeds set per foraging bout, and the GR seeds set at the shortest distances, were produced following leafcutting bee visits. In contrast, GR seeds were found at the longest distances following bumble bee visits. Values for honey bees were intermediate. The ranking of bee species based on seed curves correlated well with field-based gene flow estimates. Thus, differential seed curves of bee species, which describe patterns of seed production within foraging bouts, translated into distinct abilities of bee species to move genes at a landscape level. Bee behavior at a local scale (foraging bout) helps predict gene flow and the spread of GE genes at the landscape scale.","04","2023","17","PLoS One","PloS one","Bees; Animals; Pollen; Seeds; Crops, Agricultural; Alleles; Medicago sativa; Pollination","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:52:21.588826-04:00","No","","NaT"

The present study compared the cytological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of Nsa CMS (1258A) and Pol CMS (P5A) during pollen abortion, and high-throughput sequencing of flower buds of different sizes before and after pollen abortion. The results showed that insufficient energy supply was an important physiological basis for 1258A and P5A pollen abortion, and 1258A had excessive ROS (reactive oxygen species) accumulation in the stage of pollen abortion. Functional analysis showed that Starch and sucrose metabolism and Sulfur metabolism were significantly enriched before and after pollen abortion in 1258A and P5A, and a large number of genes were down-regulated. In 1258A, 227 lncRNAs had cis-targeting regulation, and 240 cis-target genes of the lncRNAs were identified.

However, there have been limited studies on the genomic organization of the S-locus supergene due to a lack of high-quality genomic data.

In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the interaction during the tetrad development stage of one member of the ELMOD protein family, ELMOD_E, with two others, MCR/ELMOD_B and ELMOD_A, can change the morphology of apertures from colpus (elongated) to pore (round). Here, comparative transcriptome analysis is used to identify candidate genes involved in the determination of pollen aperture morphology in Papaveraceae (order Ranunculales). Furthermore, the role of ELMOD genes in the genetic determinism of aperture shape was tested by comparative analysis of their expression levels using RNA-seq data and RT-qPCR. Two pairs of species belonging to two different subfamilies were used. Within each pair, one species has colpate pollen and the other porate (Fumarioideae-<i>Dactylicapnos torulosa</i>, 6-colpate, and <i>Fumaria bracteosa</i>, pantoporate; Papaveroideae-<i>Eschsholzia californica</i>, 5-7 colpate, and <i>Roemeria refracta</i>, 6-porate). The transcriptomes were obtained at the tetrad stage of pollen development. A total of 531 DEGs were found between the colpate and porate pollen species groups. The results from RNA-seq and RT-qPCR indicate that pollen aperture shape is not determined by the relative expression levels of <i>ELMOD</i> family genes in Papaveraceae. However, genes related to callose wall formation or cytoskeleton organisation were found, these processes being involved in pollen aperture formation. In addition, transcriptomes from anthers with pollen during the tetrad stage of three species (<i>D. torulosa</i>, <i>R. refracta</i>, and <i>F. bracteosa</i>) were obtained for the first time.

However, F<sub>1</sub> interspecific hybrids tend to be highly sterile due to low levels of genetic homozygosity. This can be addressed by meiotic polyploidization, which has the advantage of reducing breeding time and being able to promote genetic recombination resulting in many variant progenies. High temperatures have been proven to induce 2n gametes via hindering a spindle formation in several plants, but little has been reported in lilies. In the present study, after observing the correlation between the development of the pollen mother cells (PMCs) and the length of the buds, 28-31 mm long buds were selected as the experimental material, which were at the stage of prophase I-metaphase I. Individual buds were induced at different temperatures (40 &#xb0;C, 42 &#xb0;C, and 44 &#xb0;C) and durations (4 h and 6 h) using self-made multiwire heating equipment, and successfully induced fertile male gametes.. The best results were achieved with treatment of 42 &#xb0;C for 4 h, reaching a maximum fertile pollen induction rate of 36.64%, while bud mortality was 40%. Two chemicals, colchicine and oryzalin, were also used by injection, and only the treatment with oryzalin obtained fertile gametes, with the highest fertile gamete rate of 15.39% at a concentration of 0.005%, while the bud mortality was 36.67%. This suggests that high temperatures have a superior effect on lily 2n gamete induction. In addition, the pollen obtained from the 6 h induction of high temperature was significantly larger than that from the 4 h induction, with an average diameter of 138.64 &#x3bc;m and 107.88 &#x3bc;m, respectively, 2.35 and 1.84 times wider than haploid pollen. The fertile pollen was crossed with four cultivars and two species, and a total of 267 embryonic seeds were obtained, with the highest embryonic rate of 4.52% in OT lily 'Mister Cas' as the parent, which had a germination rate of 26.27%.

The molecular mechanisms that govern the transition of plant somatic cells to embryogenic cells are largely unknown. There is increasing evidence that auxins mediate this transition and play a key role in somatic embryo development, although data on woody species are very limited. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics and possible role of endogenous auxin during SE in cork oak (<i>Quercus suber</i> L.). The auxin content was low in somatic cells before cell reprogramming, while it increased after induction of embryogenesis, as revealed by immunofluorescence assays. Cellular accumulation of endogenous auxin was also detected at the later stages of somatic embryo development. These changes in auxin levels correlated with the expression patterns of the auxin biosynthesis (<i>QsTAR2</i>) and signaling (<i>QsARF5</i>) genes, which were upregulated after SE induction. Treatments with the inhibitor of auxin biosynthesis, kynurenine, reduced the proliferation of proembryogenic masses and impaired further embryo development. <i>QsTAR2</i> and <i>QsARF5</i> were downregulated after kynurenine treatment.

To investigate the microspore development process and gene expression changes after the introduction of <i>orf138</i> and <i>Rfo</i>, cytological observation and transcriptome analysis were performed using a maintainer line, an Ogura CMS line, and a restorer line. Semithin sections of microspores at different developmental stages showed that the degradation of tapetal cells began at the tetrad stage in the Ogura CMS line, while it occurred at the bicellular microspore stage to the tricellular microspore stage in the maintainer and restorer lines. Therefore, early degradation of tapetal cells may be the cause of pollen abortion. Transcriptome analysis results showed that a total of 1287 DEGs had consistent expression trends in the maintainer line and restorer line, but were significantly up- or down-regulated in the Ogura CMS line, indicating that they may be closely related to pollen abortion. Functional annotation showed that the 1287 core DEGs included a large number of genes related to pollen development, oxidative phosphorylation, carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism.

In this study, we investigated the molecular regulatory networks involved in the fertilization process in Korean pine ovules through anatomical observation, physiological and biochemical assays, and transcriptome sequencing technology. The morphological and physiological results indicated that fertilization proceeds through the demise of the proteinaceous vacuole, egg cell division, and pollen tube elongation. Auxin, cytokinin, soluble sugar, and soluble starch contents begin to decline upon fertilization. Transcriptomic data analysis revealed a large number of differentially expressed genes at different times before and after fertilization. These genes were primarily involved in pathways associated with plant hormone signal transduction, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, fructose metabolism, and mannose metabolism. The expression levels of several key genes were further confirmed by qRT-PCR.

After 21 d, the chickens remained in their treatment groups and fed standard grower diet. The results of the current study revealed that BP inclusion had positively improved (P &lt; 0.05) average weekly feed intake (FI), body weight (BW), body weight gain (BWG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in both sexes. However, the apparent nutrient digestibility, metabolizable energy (ME), and nutrient digestibility were not affected by the dietary BP. Furthermore, carcass yield in both sexes was improved (P &lt; 0.05) by BP inclusion levels. In contrast, meat pH, shear force, and sensory evaluation in both sexes were not affected (P &gt; 0.05). The results suggest that the broiler chicks can utilize bioactive compounds in BP when supplemented in the starter diets and subsequently improve their growth parameters throughout the growing period as well as carcass yield at slaughter age. These positive improvements could be due to high quality amino acids, essential oils, vitamins, and minerals of BP. Therefore, it is concluded that BP inclusion level of 12 g/kg or more in the starter diets could have positive effects on growth performance and carcass yield at slaughter age without causing adverse effects on meat physico-chemical properties and sensory evaluation in both male and female broiler chickens.","05","2023","01","Poult Sci","Poultry science","antibiotic; bee pollen; broiler; carcass characteristic; live weight","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:43:10.771923-04:00","No","","NaT"

"120","Conflicting constraints on male mating success shape reward size in pollen-rewarding plants.","37040609","10.1002/ajb2.16158","Pollen-rewarding plants face two conflicting constraints: They must prevent consumptive emasculation while remaining attractive to pollen-collecting visitors. Small pollen packages (the quantity of pollen available in a single visit) may discourage visitors from grooming (reducing consumptive loss) but may also decrease a plant's attractiveness to pollen-collecting visitors. What package size best balances these two constraints? We modeled the joint effects of pollinators' grooming behaviors and package size preferences on the optimal package size (i.e., the size that maximizes pollen donation). We then used this model to examine Darwin's conjecture that selection should favor increased pollen production in pollen-rewarding plants. When package size preferences are weak, minimizing package size reduces grooming losses and should be favored (as in previous theoretical studies). Stronger preferences select for larger packages despite the associated increase to grooming loss because loss associated with nonremoval of smaller packages is even greater. Total pollen donation increases with production (as Darwin suggested). However, if floral visitation declines or packages size preference increases with overall pollen availability, the fraction of pollen donated may decline as per-plant pollen production increases. Hence, increasing production may result in diminishing returns. Pollen-rewarding plants can balance conflicting constraints on pollen donation by producing intermediate-sized pollen packages. Strictly pollen-rewarding plants may have responded to past selection to produce more pollen in total, but diminishing returns may limit the strength of that selection.","04","2023","11","Am J Bot","American journal of botany","floral reward; foraging preferences; male mating success; mathematical model; pollen donation; pollen packaging; pollen presentation theory; pollinator grooming; pollinator reward preferences","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:54:16.845503-04:00","No","","NaT"

We used generalized additive models to investigate the long-term trends in pollen beetle annual, seasonal and monthly counts from Rothamsted 12.2&#x2009;m suction-traps. We hypothesised that the beetle's abundance is positively related to the area of oilseed rape at a national and regional level. We used random forest models to investigate the inter-generational relationship within years. Although Brassicogethes aeneus annual counts and area of oilseed rape grown in the UK both increased by 162% and 113%, respectively, over the time period studied, they were not significantly related. The size of the immigrating pollen beetle population (up to 1 June) can be explained both by the size of the population in the previous summer and prevailing winter temperatures, indicating a positive feedback mechanism. Currently, pollen beetle numbers continue to increase in the UK, meaning that control issues may persist. However the relationship between counts in spring, during the susceptible phase of the crop, and counts in the previous summer indicates that it may be possible to forecast the counts of the spring migration of Brassicogethes aeneus a few months in advance using suction-trap samples, which could aid decisions on control options. &#xa9; 2023 The Authors.

"123","Stable pollination service in a generalist high Arctic community despite the warming climate.","37035419","10.1002/ecm.1551","Insects provide key pollination services in most terrestrial biomes, but this service depends on a multistep interaction between insect and plant. An insect needs to visit a flower, receive pollen from the anthers, move to another conspecific flower, and finally deposit the pollen on a receptive stigma. Each of these steps may be affected by climate change, and focusing on only one of them (e.g., flower visitation) may miss important signals of change in service provision. In this study, we combine data on visitation, pollen transport, and single-visit pollen deposition to estimate functional outcomes in the high Arctic plant-pollinator network of Zackenberg, Northeast Greenland, a model system for global warming-associated impacts in pollination services. Over two decades of rapid climate warming, we sampled the network repeatedly: in 1996, 1997, 2010, 2011, and 2016. Although the flowering plant and insect communities and their interactions varied substantially between years, as expected based on highly variable Arctic weather, there was no detectable directional change in either the structure of flower-visitor networks or estimated pollen deposition. For flower-visitor networks compiled over a single week, species phenologies caused major within-year variation in network structure despite consistency across years. Weekly networks for the middle of the flowering season emerged as especially important because most pollination service can be expected to be provided by these large, highly nested networks. Our findings suggest that pollination ecosystem service in the high Arctic is remarkably resilient. This resilience may reflect the plasticity of Arctic biota as an adaptation to extreme and unpredictable weather. However, most pollination service was contributed by relatively few fly taxa (Diptera: <i>Spilogona sanctipauli</i> and <i>Drymeia segnis</i> [Muscidae] and species of <i>Rhamphomyia</i> [Empididae]). If these key pollinators are negatively affected by climate change, network structure and the pollination service that depends on it would be seriously compromised.","04","2023","11","Ecol Monogr","Ecological monographs","Dryas; diptera; flower visitor; phenology; pollen deposition; pollen transport","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:21:52.795989-04:00","No","","NaT"

Among various developmental stages of plants, even a slight rise in temperature during reproductive development proves detrimental, thus making sexual reproduction heat vulnerable. In this context, male gametophyte or pollen development stages are the most sensitive ones. High-temperature exposure induces pollen abortion, reducing pollen viability and germination rate with a concomitant effect on seed yield. This review summarizes the ultrastructural, morphological, biochemical, and molecular changes underpinning high temperature-induced aberrations in male gametophytes. Specifically, we highlight the temperature sensing cascade operating in pollen, involving reactive oxygen species (ROS), heat shock factors (HSFs), a hormones and transcriptional regulatory network.

However, their sources can be located farther, outside cities' borders. So, the fundamental question remains as to how frequent longer-range pollen transport incidents are and if they may actually comprise high-risk allergy cases. The aim was to study the pollen exposure on a high-altitude location where only scarce vegetation exists, by biomonitoring airborne pollen and symptoms of grass pollen allergic individuals, locally. The research was carried out in 2016 in the alpine research station UFS, located at 2650&#xa0;m height, on the Zugspitze Mountain in Bavaria, Germany. Airborne pollen was monitored by use of portable Hirst-type volumetric traps. As a case study, grass pollen-allergic human volunteers were registering their symptoms daily during the peak of the grass pollen season in 2016, during a 2-week stay on Zugspitze, 13-24 June. The possible origin of some pollen types was identified using back trajectory model HYSPLIT for 27 air mass backward trajectories up to 24&#xa0;h. We found that episodes of high aeroallergen concentrations may occur even at such a high-altitude location. More than 1000 pollen grains m<sup>-3</sup> of air were measured on the UFS within only 4&#xa0;days. It was confirmed that the locally detected bioaerosols originated from at least Switzerland, and up to northwest France, even eastern American Continent, because of frequent long-distance transport. Such far-transported pollen may explain the observed allergic symptoms in sensitized individuals at a remarkable rate of 87&#xa0;% during the study period. Long-distance transport of aeroallergens can cause allergic symptoms in sensitized individuals, as evidenced in a sparse-vegetation, low-exposure, 'low-risk' alpine environment. We strongly suggest that we need cross-border pollen monitoring to investigate long-distance pollen transport, as its occurrence seems both frequent and clinically relevant.","04","2023","21","Sci Total Environ","The Science of the total environment","Aerobiology; Airborne pollen; Alpine environment; Climate change; Long-distance transport; Pollen allergy","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:41:41.275429-04:00","No","","NaT"

Understanding pollen dispersion from grass communities is especially relevant due to their high species-specific allergenicity and heterogeneously distributed source areas. Here, we aimed to address questions concerning fine level heterogeneity in grass pollen release and dispersion processes, with a focus on characterizing the taxonomic composition of airborne grass pollen over the grass flowering season using eDNA and molecular ecology methods. High resolution grass pollen concentrations were compared between three microscale sites (&lt;300&#xa0;m apart) in a rural area in Worcestershire, UK. The grass pollen was modelled with local meteorology in a MANOVA (Multivariate ANOVA) approach to investigate factors relevant to pollen release and dispersion. Simultaneously, airborne pollen was sequenced using Illumina MySeq for metabarcoding, analysed against a reference database with all UK grasses using the R packages DADA2 and phyloseq to calculate Shannon's Diversity Index (&#x3b1;-diversity). The flowering phenology of a local Festuca rubra population was observed. We found that grass pollen concentrations varied on a microscale level, likely attributed to local topography and the dispersion distance of pollen from flowering grasses in local source areas. Six genera (Agrostis, Alopecurus, Arrhenatherum, Holcus, Lolium and Poa) dominated the pollen season, comprising on average 77&#xa0;% of the relative abundance of grass species reads. Temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, turbulence and wind speeds were found to be relevant for grass pollen release and dispersion processes.

Here, we show a cell census of rice pistils before fertilization through the use of droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing. The ab initio marker identification validated by in situ hybridization assists with cell-type annotation, revealing cell heterogeneity between ovule- and carpel-originated cells. A comparison of 1N (gametophyte) and 2N (sporophyte) nuclei identifies the developmental path of germ cells in ovules with typical resetting of pluripotency before the sporophyte-gametophyte transition, while trajectory analysis of carpel-originated cells suggests previously neglected features of epidermis specification and style function.

Noteworthy, rFlaA:Betv1 induced both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses which were differentially regulated. However, the mechanism by which flagellin fusion proteins modulate allergen-specific immune responses, especially the mechanisms underlying IL-1&#x3b2; secretion and their contribution to the overall immune responses remains elusive. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the production of IL-1&#x3b2; from rFlaA:Betv1 stimulated macrophages. Macrophages were derived from mouse peritoneal-, human buffy-coat-, and PMA-differentiated THP-1 (wild type or lacking either ASC, NLRP3, or NLRC4) cells. Macrophages were stimulated with non-modified rFlaA:Betv1, mutant variants lacking either the flagellin DC0 domain or a sequence motif formerly described to mediate TLR5-activation, and respective controls in the presence or absence of inhibitors interfering with MAPK- and NF<i>&#x3ba;</i>B-signaling. Cytokine secretion was analyzed by ELISA and intracellular signaling by Western Blot. To study the contribution of IL-1&#x3b2; to the overall immune responses, IL1R-deficient mouse peritoneal macrophages were used. rFlaA:Betv1 consistently activated all types of investigated macrophages, inducing higher IL-1&#x3b2; secretion compared with the equimolar mixture of both proteins. rFlaA:Betv1-induced activation of THP-1 macrophages was shown to be independent of either the TLR5-activating sequence motif or the flagellin DC0 domain but depended on both NLRP3- and NLRC4-inflammasomes. In addition, NF&#x3ba;B and SAP/JNK MAP kinases regulated rFlaA:Betv1-induced inflammasome activation and cytokine secretion by modulating pro-Caspase-1- and pro-IL-1&#x3b2;-expression in THP-1 macrophages. Finally, lack of IL-1&#x3b2; positive feedback <i>via</i> the IL1R strongly diminished the rFlaA:Betv1-induced secretion of IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x3b1; from peritoneal macrophages. The mechanisms contributing to rFlaA:Betv1-induced IL-1&#x3b2; secretion from macrophages were shown to be complex, involving both NLRC4- and NLRP3-inflammsomes, as well as NF&#x3ba;B- and SAP/JNK MAP kinase-signaling.

Male gametogenesis in developing angiosperm pollen involves distinctive changes in cell morphogenesis. Re-shaping and elongation of the generative cell (GC) are linked to the formation of a GC cytoplasmic projection connected to the vegetative cell nucleus. Although genetic control of GC morphogenesis is unknown, we suspected the involvement of the germline-specific MYB transcription factor DUO POLLEN1 (DUO1). We used light and fluorescence microscopy to examine male germline development in pollen of wild-type Arabidopsis and in four allelic duo1 mutants expressing introduced cell markers. Our analysis shows that the undivided GC in duo1 pollen forms a cytoplasmic projection, but the cell body fails to elongate. In contrast GCs of cyclin-dependent kinase function mutants, which fail to divide like duo1 mutants, achieve normal morphogenesis. We conclude that DUO1 has an essential role in the elongation of the GC, but DUO1-independent pathways control the development of the GC cytoplasmic projection.

These included investigations on morphology, light microscopy and histochemistry, and analysis of flowers scent using GC-MS. The pollinators and the mechanisms of pollination were recorded through focal observations. The yellow flowers of V. pompona are fragrant and offer nectar as reward.

The pollination system of V. pompona is not species-specific, but its flowers are strongly adapted to pollination by large Eulaema males. Pollination mechanism is based in a combination of perfume collection and nectar seeking.

Our study describes a simple and highly effective method for improving both directions of haploid production. Lower temperatures dramatically enhance pollen vigour but reduce haploid induction efficiency, while higher temperatures act oppositely. Importantly, the effects of temperatures on pollen vigour and on haploid induction efficiency are independent. These features enable us to easily induce maternal haploids at around 24.8% by using pollen of inducers grown at lower temperatures to pollinate target plants, followed by switching to high temperatures for haploid induction. Moreover, paternal haploid induction can be simplified and enhanced by growing the inducer at higher temperatures pre- and post-pollination.

It is well known that kinase-mediated phosphorylation inactivates ADF/cofilin. Here, however, we found that the activity of Arabidopsis ADF7 is enhanced by CDPK16-mediated phosphorylation. We found that CDPK16 interacts with ADF7 both in vitro and in vivo, and it enhances ADF7-mediated actin depolymerization and severing in vitro in a calcium-dependent manner. Accordingly, the rate of actin turnover is reduced in cdpk16 pollen and the amount of actin filaments increases significantly at the tip of cdpk16 pollen tubes. CDPK16 phosphorylates ADF7 at Serine128 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phospho-mimetic mutant ADF7S128D has enhanced actin-depolymerizing activity compared to ADF7. Strikingly, we found that failure in the phosphorylation of ADF7 at Ser128 impairs its function in promoting actin turnover in vivo, which suggests that this phospho-regulation mechanism is biologically significant. Thus, we reveal that CDPK16-mediated phosphorylation up-regulates ADF7 to promote actin turnover in pollen.","04","2023","17","PLoS Biol","PLoS biology","Actin Cytoskeleton; Actin Depolymerizing Factors; Actins; Arabidopsis; Destrin; Phosphorylation; Pollen Tube; Arabidopsis Proteins","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:48:39.805455-04:00","No","","NaT"

Starch is a biologically and commercially important glucose polymer synthesized by plants as semicrystalline starch granules (SGs). Because SG morphology affects starch properties, mutants with altered SG morphology may be useful in breeding crops with desirable starch properties, including potentially novel properties. In this study, we employed a simple screen for mutants with altered SG morphology in barley (Hordeum vulgare). We isolated mutants that formed compound SGs together with the normal simple SGs in the endosperm and found that they were allelic mutants of the starch biosynthesis genes ISOAMYLASE1 (HvISA1) and FLOURY ENDOSPERM 6 (HvFLO6), encoding starch debranching enzyme and CARBOHYDRATE-BINDING MODULE 48-containing protein, respectively. We generated the hvflo6 hvisa1 double mutant and showed that it had significantly reduced starch biosynthesis and developed shrunken grains. In contrast to starch, soluble &#x3b1;-glucan, phytoglycogen, and sugars accumulated to higher levels in the double mutant than in the single mutants. In addition, the double mutants showed defects in SG morphology in the endosperm and in the pollen. This novel genetic interaction suggests that hvflo6 acts as an enhancer of the sugary phenotype caused by hvisa1 mutation.","04","2023","05","Theor Appl Genet","TAG. Theoretical and applied genetics.

Brassinosteroids (BRs) have well-documented functions in cell elongation, but their molecular mechanisms in pollen tube growth, especially in the SI response, remain elusive. Here, exogenously applied brassinolide (BL), an active BR, countered incompatible pollen tube growth inhibition during the SI response in pear. Antisense repression of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (PbrBZR1), a critical component of BR signaling, blocked the positive effect of BL on pollen tube elongation. Further analyses revealed that PbrBZR1 binds to the promoter of EXPANSIN-LIKE A3 (PbrEXLA3) to activate its expression. PbrEXLA3 encodes an expansin that promotes pollen tube elongation in pear. The stability of dephosphorylated PbrBZR1 was substantially reduced in incompatible pollen tubes, where it is targeted by ARIADNE2.3 (PbrARI2.3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is strongly expressed in pollen. Our results show that during the SI response, PbrARI2.3 accumulates and negatively regulates pollen tube growth by accelerating the degradation of PbrBZR1 via the 26S proteasome pathway. Together, our results show that a ubiquitin-mediated modification participates in BR signaling in pollen and reveal the molecular mechanism by which BRs regulate S-RNase-based SI.","04","2023","03","Plant Physiol","Plant physiology","BR; PbrARI2.3; PbrBZR1; SI; pear; pollen tube","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:47:39.581428-04:00","No","","NaT"

In this review, we discuss key distinctions in respiratory physiology between asthma and severe asthma, including the magnitude of airway hyperresponsiveness and recently discovered disease drivers that underpin this phenomenon such as structural changes, airway remodeling, airway smooth muscle hypertrophy, altered airway smooth muscle calcium signaling, and inflammation. We also explore state-of-the-art mouse lung function measurement techniques that accurately recapitulate the human scenario as well as recent advances in precision cut lung slices and cell culture systems. Furthermore, we consider how these techniques have been applied to recently developed mouse models of asthma, severe asthma, and asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap, to examine the effects of clinically relevant exposures (including ovalbumin, house dust mite antigen in the absence or presence of cigarette smoke, cockroach allergen, pollen, and respiratory microbes) and to increase our understanding of lung physiology in these diseases and identify new therapeutic targets. Lastly, we focus on recent studies that examine the effects of diet on asthma outcomes, including high fat diet and asthma, low iron diet during pregnancy and predisposition to asthma development in offspring, and environmental exposures on asthma outcomes. We conclude our review with a discussion of new clinical concepts in asthma and severe asthma that warrant investigation and how we could utilize mouse models and advanced lung physiology measurement systems to identify factors and mechanisms with potential for therapeutic targeting.","04","2023","04","Front Physiol","Frontiers in physiology","airway hyperresponsiveness3; asthma1; lung function2; mouse models4; severe asthma5","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:14:34.939810-04:00","No","","NaT"

Here, we present the plant-pollinator network of caraway in a central European agricultural landscape, focusing on two diverse potential pollinator taxa, Diptera: Brachycera (= true flies) and Hymenoptera (sawflies, bees, and wasps). We specifically studied qualitative differences in interactions between the two insect taxa as well as the intraday and intraseasonal variability of the network. Insect and pollen plant species determination was done via morphological identification and DNA (meta)barcoding. In total, 121 species representing 33 families of Hymenoptera and Brachycera were found to carry caraway pollen. These taxa included many nonhoneybee and nonhoverfly species, showing a wide taxonomic breadth of potential pollinators and a higher network complexity than previously anticipated. There are distinct qualitative differences between Brachycera and Hymenoptera networks, suggesting complementary roles of both taxa in the pollination of native and crop plants. Strong intraday differences in potential pollinator diversity make it necessary to collect insects and pollen at different times of the day to compile complete plant-pollinator networks.

This study was designed to evaluate the anti-fibrotic role of FZHY in hepatic fibrosis and to elucidate the potential mechanisms. Network pharmacology was assayed to identify the interrelationships among compounds of FZHY, potential targets and putative pathways on anti-LF. Then the core pharmaceutical target for FZHY against LF was verified by serum proteomic analysis. Further in vivo and in vitro assays were performed to verify the prediction of the pharmaceutical network. The network pharmacology analysis revealed that a total of 175 FZHY-LF crossover proteins were filtered into a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network complex and designated as the potential targets of FZHY against LF, and the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway was further explored according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis.

The occurrence of the infection can be also due to environmental stress, like urbanisation, air pollution and increased air temperature, especially under the ongoing climate change. The aim of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that worsened air quality and fewer green areas may favour the higher frequency of common viral infections, particularly in a common tree in temperate and continental climates, Betula pendula ROTH. We examined 18 trees, during the years 2015-2017, the same always for each year, in the region of Augsburg, Germany. By specific PCR, the frequency of two viruses, Cherry leaf roll virus (CLRV, genus Nepovirus, family Secoviridae), which is frequent in birch trees, and a novel virus tentatively named birch idaeovirus (BIV), which has been only recently described, were determined in pollen samples. The occurrence of the viruses was examined against the variables of urban index, air pollution (O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>), air temperature, and tree morphometrics (trunk perimeter, tree height, crown height and diameter). Generalized Non-linear models (binomial logit with backward stepwise removal of independent variables) were employed. During the study period, both CLRV and BIV were distributed widely throughout the investigated birch individuals. CLRV seemed to be rather cosmopolitan and was present independent of any abiotic factor. BIV's occurrence was mostly determined by higher values of the urban index and of NO<sub>2</sub>. Urban birch trees, located next to high-traffic roads with higher NO<sub>2</sub> levels, are more likely to be infected by BIV. Increased environmental stress may lead to more plant viral infections. Here we suggest that this is particularly true for urban spaces, near high-traffic roads, where plants may be more stressed, and we recommend taking mitigation measures for controlling negative human interventions.","04","2023","27","Environ Pollut","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","Air pollution; Microbial ecology; Nitrogen dioxide; Plant ecology; Pollen; Urban ecology; Humans; Trees; Betula; Nepovirus; Urbanization; Nitrogen Dioxide; Plants","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:53:02.389592-04:00","No","","NaT"

Stressors, such as pesticides, may accelerate this decline by mobilizing internal lipid to facilitate the stress response. Whether bees with stressor-induced accelerated lipid loss vary from controls in both the onset of foraging and nutritional quality of collected pollen is not fully understood. We asked whether stressors affect foraging behavior through the depletion of abdominal lipid, and whether stress-induced lipid depletion causes bees to forage earlier and for fattier pollen. We tested this by treating newly emerged bees with one of two pesticides, pyriproxyfen (a juvenile hormone analog) and spirodiclofen (a fatty acid synthesis disruptor), that may affect energy homeostasis in non-target insects. Bees fed these pesticides were returned to hives to observe the onset of foraging behavior. We also sampled foraging bees to assay both abdominal lipids and dietary lipid content of their corbicular pollen. Initially, spirodiclofen-treated bees had significantly more abdominal lipids, but these declined faster compared with controls. These bees also collected less, yet more lipid-rich, pollen. Our results suggest that bees with accelerated lipid decline rely on dietary lipid content and must collect fattier pollen to compensate. Pyriproxyfen treatment reduced the age at first forage but did not affect abdominal or collected pollen lipid levels, suggesting that accelerated fat body depletion is not a prerequisite for precocious foraging.","04","2023","13","J Exp Biol","The Journal of experimental biology"," Apis mellifera ; Adipose tissue; Fat body; Foraging; Pesticides; Bees; Animals; Pesticides; Spiro Compounds; Pollen; Lipids","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:47:59.667414-04:00","No","","NaT"

The cell viability on the scaffold was evaluated by MTT assay. Osteogenic differentiation of the seeded stem cells was detected by evaluating calcium content, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and the expression of bone-specific genes. The viability of cells was not affected by propolis-coated and uncoated fabricated scaffolds, while higher calcium content, ALP activity, and expression of RUNX-2, type I collagen, osteocalcin, and osteonectin were observed in cells differentiated on propolis-coated PLGA scaffold on days 7, 14, and 21 of differentiation compared to PLGA scaffold.

Although much has been learned about the biosynthesis of sporopollenin precursors in the tapetum, the nutritive cell layer surrounding developing microspores, little is known about how the biopolymer is assembled on the microspore surface. We identified SCULP1 (SKS clade universal in pollen) as a seed plant conserved clade of the multicopper oxidase family. We showed that SCULP1 in common wheat (Triticum aestivum) is specifically expressed in the microspore when sporopollenin assembly takes place, localized to the developing exine, and binds p-coumaric acid in&#xa0;vitro.

Colony-level experiments are critical for understanding the mechanisms by which nutritional stress affects individual honey bee physiology and pushes honey bee colonies to collapse. In this study, we investigated the impact of pollen restriction on key markers of honey bee physiology, main elements of the immune system, and predominant honey bee viruses. To achieve this objective, we uncoupled the effects of behavior, age, and nutritional conditions using a new colony establishment technique designed to control size, demography, and genetic background. Our results showed that the expression of storage proteins, including vitellogenin (<i>vg</i>) and royal jelly major protein 1 (<i>mrjp1</i>), were significantly associated with nursing, pollen ingestion, and older age. On the other hand, genes involved in hormonal regulation including insulin-like peptides (<i>ilp1</i> and <i>ilp2</i>) and methyl farnesoate epoxidase (<i>mfe</i>), exhibited higher expression levels in young foragers from colonies not experiencing pollen restriction. In contrast, pollen restriction induced higher levels of insulin-like peptides in old nurses. On the other hand, we found a strong effect of behavior on the expression of all immune genes, with higher expression levels in foragers. In contrast, the effects of nutrition and age were significant only the expression of the regulatory gene <i>dorsal</i>. We also found multiple interactions of the experimental variables on viral titers, including higher Deformed wing virus (DWV) titers associated with foraging and age-related decline. In addition, nutrition significantly affected DWV titers in young nurses, with higher titers induced by pollen ingestion. In contrast, higher levels of Black queen cell virus (BQCV) were associated with pollen restriction. Finally, correlation, PCA, and NMDS analyses proved that behavior had had the strongest effect on gene expression and viral titers, followed by age and nutrition.

Today, the most common technique to identify airborne pollen species and to monitor their concentrations is based on manual analysis. Here, we present a new, low-cost, real-time optical pollen sensor, called Beenose, that automatically counts and identifies pollen grains by performing measurements at multiple scattering angles. We describe the data pre-processing steps and discuss the various statistical and machine learning methods that have been implemented to distinguish different pollen species. The analysis is based on a set of 12 pollen species, several of which were selected for their allergic potency. Our results show that Beenose can provide a consistent clustering of the pollen species based on their size properties, and that pollen particles can be separated from non-pollen ones. More importantly, 9 out of 12 pollen species were correctly identified with a prediction score exceeding 78%. Classification errors occur for species with similar optical behaviour, suggesting that other parameters should be considered to provide even more robust pollen identification.","03","2023","31","Sensors (Basel)","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","machine learning; optical sensor; pollen monitoring; real time; Pollen; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Machine Learning","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:09:57.632359-04:00","No","","NaT"
"167","Differential bumble bee gene expression associated with pathogen infection and pollen diet.","36991318","10.1186/s12864-023-09143-5","Diet and parasitism can have powerful effects on host gene expression. However, how specific dietary components affect host gene expression that could feed back to affect parasitism is relatively unexplored in many wild species. Recently, it was discovered that consumption of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) pollen reduced severity of gut protozoan pathogen Crithidia bombi infection in Bombus impatiens bumble bees. Despite the dramatic and consistent medicinal effect of sunflower pollen, very little is known about the mechanism(s) underlying this effect. However, sunflower pollen extract increases rather than suppresses C. bombi growth in vitro, suggesting that sunflower pollen reduces C. bombi infection indirectly via changes in the host. Here, we analyzed whole transcriptomes of B. impatiens workers to characterize the physiological response to sunflower pollen consumption and C. bombi infection to isolate the mechanisms underlying the medicinal effect. B. impatiens workers were inoculated with either C. bombi cells (infected) or a sham control (un-infected) and fed either sunflower or wildflower pollen ad libitum. Whole abdominal gene expression profiles were then sequenced with Illumina NextSeq 500 technology. Among infected bees, sunflower pollen upregulated immune transcripts, including the anti-microbial peptide hymenoptaecin, Toll receptors and serine proteases. In both infected and un-infected bees, sunflower pollen upregulated putative detoxification transcripts and transcripts associated with the repair and maintenance of gut epithelial cells. Among wildflower-fed bees, infected bees downregulated immune transcripts associated with phagocytosis and the phenoloxidase cascade. Taken together, these results indicate dissimilar immune responses between sunflower- and wildflower-fed bumble bees infected with C. bombi, a response to physical damage to gut epithelial cells caused by sunflower pollen, and a strong detoxification response to sunflower pollen consumption. Identifying host responses that drive the medicinal effect of sunflower pollen in infected bumble bees may broaden our understanding of plant-pollinator interactions and provide opportunities for effective management of bee pathogens.","03","2023","31","BMC Genomics","BMC genomics","Bumble bee; Detoxification; Gut epithelial cells; Immune transcripts; Parasitism; Sunflower pollen; Bees; Animals; Pollen; Helianthus; Crithidia; Diet; Gene Expression","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:51:14.539898-04:00","No","","NaT"

However, previous work has almost exclusively focussed on bees and other diurnal invertebrate taxa. This study aimed to assess the relative contribution of diurnal and nocturnal insects to the pollination of bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg.), a common and widespread species aggregate across Europe, which has been identified as a key source of pollen and nectar for diurnal pollinators. Bramble flower visitation rates by diurnal and nocturnal insects were quantified by analysing over 380,000 interval photographs taken over a 3-day period across 10 sites. A pollinator exclusion experiment was also undertaken to assess the importance of diurnal and nocturnal insects for pollination by analysing pollen deposition on 480 bramble stigmas of nocturnally exposed, diurnally exposed and unvisited control flowers across all sites. Flower visitation was significantly higher during the day, comprising 83% of all visits made by a range of taxa. Nocturnal visitation was almost exclusively by moths. Crucially, pollen deposition rates of bramble were significantly higher during the night compared with the day. No relationship was detected between pollen counts and flower visitation rates, suggesting that moths are more efficient pollinators of bramble compared with diurnal insects. Overall, this work provides further evidence of the value of bramble as a resource for pollinators and demonstrates that moths likely play an important role in bramble pollination.","03","2023","31","PLoS One","PloS one","Bees; Animals; Plant Nectar; Moths; Rubus; Ecosystem; Insecta; Pollen","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:52:37.728862-04:00","No","","NaT"

Recurrent wheezing is defined as more than three episodes of wheezing in the past year. Many studies have been conducted to delineate the risk factors for recurrent wheezing and to predict which of these children will progress to asthma. Most studies about risk factors and the clinicodemographic profile of children with recurrent wheeze have been carried out in developed nations. Data in developing countries may differ. This study was carried out to identify risk factors associated with recurrent wheezing in children in a tertiary care center. Materials and methods It was a retrospective, matched case-control study conducted over a period of two years (July 2019 to July 2021). Records of children aged one month to 12 years who came to pediatric OPD or were admitted to a pediatric ward with a history of recurrent wheezing were included in the study. Cases with uncontrolled recurrent wheezing diagnosed by examination with an unreliable history and those with a global developmental delay were excluded from the study. The study involved the hospital records of 60 children. Of these, 30 were recurrent wheezers, and 30 were non-wheezers (controls). Data were collected with detailed proformas from case histories and examination sheets. The proforma had several known and suspected risk factors associated with wheezes. Each risk factor was studied and compared with the control group. The risk factors included in this study were male gender, not exclusively breastfed, history of bottle feeding, exposure to vehicles; exposure to pollen; exposure to animals; using an agarbatti or dhoop, passive smoking, or playing with a soft toy. Data were entered in an Excel sheet, and appropriate statistical analyses were done. Results The male-to-female ratio was 2:1. Out of the number of cases, 73.33% were younger than six years; 56.66% of cases were not exclusively breastfed, and 43.33% were exclusively breastfed for six months; 20% of the cases were bottle-fed, and 40% of the controls were bottle-fed. The percentage of cases exposed to vehicle smoke was 26.66%, while 20% of cases had exposure to pollen and 16% of controls were exposed to pollen. 30% of cases were exposed to animals, and 23% of controls were exposed to animals. With regard to passive smoking, 16.66% of cases were exposed to passive smoking, and 20% of controls were not exposed to passive smoking. Out of the study group, 26.66% of the children played with soft toys. Of all these risk factors, a significant difference between cases and controls was found in only one factor: not being exclusively breastfed for six months. All other risk factors showed no significant difference between cases and controls. Conclusion The present study concluded that the significant risk factor that was associated with recurrent wheezing was """"not exclusively breastfeeding."""" The other factors studied that were suspected to be associated with recurrent wheezing cannot be ruled out entirely due to the relatively small size of the sample and the need to be studied further in detail.""","03","2023","30","Cureus","Cureus","exclusive breast feeding; matched controls; recurrent wheezing; risk factors; significant association; wheezing; wheezing in children","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:19:24.029233-04:00","No","","NaT"

However, the effects of <i>Pinus yunnanensis</i> pollen polysaccharides on ulcerative colitis remains unknown. In this study, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was used to induce the UC model to investigate the effects of <i>Pinus yunnanensis</i> pollen polysaccharides (PPM60) and sulfated polysaccharides (SPPM60) on UC. We evaluated the improvement of polysaccharides on UC by analyzing the levels of intestinal cytokines, serum metabolites and metabolic pathways, intestinal flora species diversity, and beneficial and harmful bacteria. The results show that purified PPM60 and its sulfated form SPPM60 effectively alleviated the disease progression of weight loss, colon shortening and intestinal injury in UC mice. On the intestinal immunity level, PPM60 and SPPM60 increased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-10, and IL-13) and decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x3b1;). On the serum metabolism level, PPM60 and SPPM60 mainly regulated the abnormal serum metabolism of UC mice by regulating the energy-related and lipid-related metabolism pathways, respectively. On the intestinal flora level, PPM60 and SPPM60 reduced the abundance of harmful bacteria (such as <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Aerococcus</i>) and induced the abundance of beneficial bacteria (such as <i>lactobacillus</i>). In summary, this study is the first to evaluate the effects of PPM60 and SPPM60 on UC from the joint perspectives of intestinal immunity, serum metabolomics, and intestinal flora, which may provide an experimental basis for plant polysaccharides as an adjuvant clinical treatment of UC.","03","2023","31","Polymers (Basel)","Polymers","gut flora; intestinal immunity; pine pollen polysaccharides; serum metabolomics; ulcerative colitis","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:49:18.722262-04:00","No","","NaT"

A comparison of the pollen seasons in both cities revealed substantially higher concentrations of lime pollen in the air of Lublin than of Szczecin. In the individual years of the study, the maximum pollen concentrations were approximately 3-fold higher, and the annual pollen sum was about 2-3 times higher in Lublin than in Szczecin.

For this purpose, bimodal populations as well as complexly shaped nanoparticles (bipyramids, cubes, and rods) were synthesized. An inter-laboratory comparison was organized for comparing the size measurements of the selected nanoparticle samples performed with electron microscopy (TEM, SEM, and TSEM), scanning probe microscopy (AFM), or small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The results demonstrate good consistency of the measured size by the different techniques in cases where special care was taken for sample preparation, instrument calibration, and the clear definition of the measurand. For each characterization method, the calibration process is described and a semi-quantitative table grouping the main error sources is proposed for estimating the uncertainties associated with the measurements. Regarding microscopy-based techniques applied to complexly shaped nanoparticles, data dispersion can be observed when the size measurements are affected by the orientation of the nanoparticles on the substrate. For the most complex materials, hybrid approaches combining several complementary techniques were tested, with the outcome being that the reliability of the size results was improved.","03","2023","31","Nanomaterials (Basel)","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)","certified reference nanomaterials; electron microscopy; hybrid metrology; scanning probe microscopy; small-angle X-ray scattering; traceable nanoparticle size measurements","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:58:05.299329-04:00","No","","NaT"

In particular, the fine description of the interactions between species requires care for taking into account various regimes such as saturation effects. We apply a method based on neural networks to discover the underlying PDE systems, which involve fractional terms and may also contain integration terms based on observed data. Our proposed framework, called Frac-PDE-Net, adapts the PDE-Net 2.0 by adding layers that are designed to learn fractional and integration terms. The key technical challenge of this task is the identifiability issue. More precisely, one needs to identify the main terms and combine similar terms among a huge number of candidates in fractional form generated by the neural network scheme due to the division operation. In order to overcome this barrier, we set up certain assumptions according to realistic biological behavior. Additionally, we use an L2-norm based term selection criterion and the sparse regression to obtain a parsimonious model. It turns out that the method of Frac-PDE-Net is capable of recovering the main terms with accurate coefficients, allowing for effective long term prediction.

Although most of the intracellular activities associated with pollen germination are controlled by RHO OF PLANTs (ROPs) and increased ROP activation accompanies pollen germination, a critical role of ROPs in this process has not yet been demonstrated. Here, by genomic editing of all four Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ROPs that are preferentially expressed in pollen, we showed that ROPs are essential for polarity establishment during pollen germination. We further identified and characterized two ROP effectors in pollen germination (REGs) through genome-wide interactor screening, Boundary of ROP domain (BDR) members BDR8 and BDR9, whose functional loss also resulted in no pollen germination. BDR8 and BDR9 were distributed in the cytosol and the vegetative nucleus of mature pollen grains but re-distributed to the plasma membrane (PM) of the germination site and to the apical PM of growing pollen tubes. We demonstrated that the PM re-distribution of BDR8 and BDR9 during pollen germination relies on ROPs but not vice versa. Furthermore, enhanced expression of BDR8 partially restored germination of rop1 pollen but had no effects on that of the quadruple rop pollen, supporting their genetic epistasis.

Herein, we demonstrate that EFOP3 and EFOP4 are co-expressed in pollen at anther stages 10-12, but loss-of-function of both EFOP3 and EFOP4 leads to male gametophyte sterility, irregular intine, and shriveled pollen grains at anther stage 12. We further established that full-length EFOP3 and EFOP4 specifically localize to the plasma membrane, and the integrity of these proteins is essential for pollen development. We observed uneven intine, less organized cellulose and reduced pectin content in mutant pollen compared with the wild-type. These, together with the misexpression of several genes related to cell wall metabolism in efop3-/- efop4+/- mutants, suggest that EFOP3 and EFOP4 may indirectly regulate the expression of these genes to affect intine formation, thus controlling Arabidopsis pollen fertility in a functionally redundant manner.

Yield components, spikelet opening, and lodicule morphology/protein profiling upon HT stress during flowering were explored in maize inbred lines Chang 7-2 and Qi 319. HT induced spikelet closure and reduced pollen shed weight (PSW) and seed set. Qi 319 that had a 7-fold lower PSW than Chang 7-2 was more susceptible to HT. A small lodicule size reduced spikelet opening rate and angle, and more vascular bundles hastened lodicule shrinking in Qi 319. Lodicules were collected for proteomics. In HT-stressed lodicules, proteins involved in stress signal, cell wall, cell constructure, carbohydrate metabolism, and phytohormone signaling were associated with stress tolerance. Among these proteins, HT downregulated expression of ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein domain2, SNAP receptor complex member11, and sterol methyltransferase2 in Qi 319 but not in Chang 7-2, agreeing well with protein abundance changes.

An amino acid insertion in the receiver domain of CaCKI1 may be the mutation responsible for tn-1. Seedlessness is a desirable trait in fruit crops because the removal of seeds is a troublesome step for consumers and processing industries. However, little knowledge is available to develop seedless chili peppers. In a previous study, a chili pepper mutant tn-1, which stably produces seedless fruits, was isolated. In this study, we report characterization of tn-1 and identification of the causative gene. Although pollen germination was normal, confocal laser microscopy observations revealed deficiency in embryo sac development in tn-1. By marker analysis, the tn-1 locus was narrowed down to a 313&#xa0;kb region on chromosome 12. Further analysis combined with mapping-by-sequencing identified CA12g21620, which encodes histidine kinase as a candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis revealed CA12g21620 was the homolog of Arabidopsis CKI1 (Cytokinin Independent 1), which plays an important role in female gametophyte development, and CA12g21620 was designated as CaCKI1. Sequence analysis revealed that tn-1 has a 3-bp insertion in the 6th exon resulting in one lysine (K) residue insertion in receiver domain of CaCKI1, and the sequence nearby the insertion is widely conserved among CKI1 orthologs in various plants. This suggested that one K residue insertion may reduce the phosphorylation relay downstream of CaCKI1 and impair normal development of female gametophyte, resulting in seedless fruits production in tn-1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that virus-induced gene silencing of CaCKI1 reduced&#xa0;normally developed female gametophyte in chili pepper. This study describes the significant role of CaCKI1 in seed development in chili pepper and the possibility of developing seedless cultivars using its mutation.","03","2023","28","Theor Appl Genet","TAG.

To date, control of pest insects has been achieved largely by applying synthetic insecticides. However, insecticide use can be seriously impacted by legislation that limits their use or by the evolution of resistance in the target pest. Thus, there is a move towards less use of insecticides and increased adoption of integrated pest management strategies using a wide range of non-chemical and chemical control methods. For good pest control there is a need to understand the mode of action and selectivity of insecticides, the life cycles of the pests and their biology and behaviours, all of which can benefit from good quality genome data. Here we present the complete assembled (chromosome level) genomes (incl. mtDNA) of 19 insect pests, Agriotes lineatus (click beetle/wireworm), Aphis gossypii (melon/cotton aphid), Bemisia tabaci (cotton whitefly), Brassicogethes aeneus (pollen beetle), Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (seedpod weevil), Chilo suppressalis (striped rice stem borer), Chrysodeixis includens (soybean looper), Diabrotica balteata (cucumber beetle), Diatraea saccharalis (sugar cane borer), Nezara viridula (green stink bug), Nilaparvata lugens (brown plant hopper), Phaedon cochleariae (mustard beetle), Phyllotreta striolata (striped flea beetle), Psylliodes chrysocephala (cabbage stem flea beetle), Spodoptera exigua (beet army worm), Spodoptera littoralis (cotton leaf worm), Diabrotica virgifera (western corn root worm), Euschistus heros (brown stink bug) and Phyllotreta cruciferae (crucifer flea beetle). For the first 15 of these we also present the annotation of genes encoding potential xenobiotic detoxification enzymes.

We searched electronic iPubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases using a set of MeSH terms and related synonyms and identified 73 eligible studies that were included for systemic review. When possible, meta-analyses were conducted. Overall meta-analysis suggests that outdoor pollen exposure may have an effect on asthma exacerbation, but caution is needed due to the low number of studies and their heterogeneity. The strongest associations were found between asthma attacks, asthma-related ED admissions or hospitalizations, and an increase in grass pollen concentration in the previous 2-day overall in children aged less than 18&#x2009;years of age. Tree pollen may increase asthma-related ED visits or admissions lagged up to 7-day overall in individuals younger than 18&#x2009;years. Rare data show that among subjects under 18&#x2009;years of age, an exposure to grass pollen lagged up to 3&#x2009;days may lower lung function. Further research considering effect modifiers of pollen sensitization, hay fever, asthma, air pollution, green spaces, and pre-existing medications is urgently warranted to better evaluate the impacts of pollen on asthma exacerbation.

Similarly, bees can prefer a specific flower sex, particularly if only one sex provides pollen. Such variation in foraging preferences could lead to divergent bee communities visiting different flower sexes of a plant species. We sampled bees visiting sunflowers to characterize bee species richness, abundance, and sex ratios on pollen-fertile and pollen-sterile cultivars. We asked whether female or male bees were more abundant on sunflowers, whether female bees were more abundant on pollen-fertile or pollen-sterile cultivars, and whether pollen presence predicted the sex of sampled bees. We further asked whether the bee community differed between pollen-fertile and pollen-sterile cultivars. Females of most bee species were more abundant on sunflowers compared to males, and females were usually more abundant on pollen-fertile cultivars. In three bee species, pollen presence was predictive of a bee's sex, with females more abundant on pollen-fertile cultivars than males. Further, the bee community differed significantly between pollen-fertile and pollen-sterile cultivars, with two bee species functioning as indicators for pollen-fertile sunflowers. Our results demonstrate that a bee's sex shapes foraging associations on sunflowers and influences abundance between pollen-fertile and pollen-sterile cultivars, and that pollen-fertile and pollen-sterile cultivars are visited by different bee communities. Bee sexes and flower pollen presence may be under-appreciated factors shaping pollination services in both agricultural and natural ecosystems, and could be important considerations for pollination of crops with pollen-fertile and pollen-sterile flowers.","03","2023","24","Environ Entomol","Environmental entomology","bees; pollen-fertile; pollen-sterile; sex ratio; sunflower","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:12:11.216773-04:00","No","","NaT"

We selected ten pesticide compounds and one metabolite and analysed their occurrence in a crop (Brassica napus) and a wild plant (Rubus fruticosus agg.), which was flowering in field edges. Nectar and pollen from both plants were collected from five spring and five winter sown B. napus fields in Ireland, and were tested for pesticide residues, using QuEChERS and Liquid Chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pesticide residues were detected in plant pollen and nectar of both plants. Most detections were from fields with no recorded application of the respective compounds in that year, but higher concentrations were observed in recently treated fields. Overall, more residues were detected in B. napus pollen and nectar than in the wild plant, and B. napus pollen had the highest mean concentration of residues. All matrices were contaminated with at least three compounds, and the most frequently detected compounds were fungicides. The most common compound mixture was comprised of the fungicides azoxystrobin, boscalid, and the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin, which was not recently applied on the fields. Our results indicate that persistent compounds like the neonicotinoids, should be continuously monitored for their presence and fate in the field environment.

OsCUGT1 was knocked out by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system to obtain the mutant oscugt1, which showed a severe dwarf and sterility phenotype. Further cytological analyses indicated that the dwarfism seen in the oscugt1 mutant might be caused by fewer and smaller cells. Histological pollen analysis suggests that the spikelet sterility in oscugt1 mutants may be caused by abnormal microsporogenesis. Moreover, multiple transgenic plants with knockdown of OsCUGT1 expression through RNA interference were obtained, which also showed obvious defects in plant height and fertility.

The exocyst and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins are involved in the regulation of the tethering and fusion of vesicles and plasma membranes, but the molecular mechanism by which they regulate pollen tube polar growth is still unclear. In this study, we found that loss of function of SEC1A, a member of the SM protein family in Arabidopsis thaliana, resulted in reducing pollen tube growth and a significant increase in pollen tube width. SEC1A was diffusely distributed in the pollen tube cytoplasm, and was more concentrated at the tip of the pollen tube. Through co-immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry screening, protein interaction analysis and in vivo microscopy, we found that SEC1A interacted with the exocyst subunit SEC6, and they mutually affected the distribution and secretion rate at the tip of the pollen tube. Meanwhile, the functional loss of SEC1A and SEC6 significantly affected the distribution of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex member SYP125 at the tip of the pollen tube, and led to the disorder of pollen tube cell wall components. Genetic analysis revealed that the pollen tube-related phenotype of the sec1a sec6 double mutant was significantly enhanced compared with their respective single mutants. Therefore, we speculated that SEC1A and SEC6 cooperatively regulate the fusion of secretory vesicles and plasma membranes in pollen tubes, thereby affecting the length and the width of pollen tubes.","04","2023","21","J Integr Plant Biol","Journal of integrative plant biology","SEC1A; SEC6; SYP125; pollen tube; vesicle secretory","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:57:04.265907-04:00","No","","NaT"

Atrazine did not affect mortality, but high exposure (37.3&#xa0;mg/L) reduced pollen and sucrose consumption, resulting in peritrophic membrane dysplasia. Sodium channels and chitin synthesis were considered potential atrazine targets, with the expression of various genes related to lipid metabolism, detoxification, immunity, and chemosensory activity being inhibited after atrazine exposure. Importantly, 37.3&#xa0;mg/L atrazine exposure substantially altered the composition and size of the gut microbial community, clearly reducing both the absolute and relative abundance of three core gram-positive taxa, Lactobacillus Firm-5, Lactobacillus Firm-4, and Bifidobacterium asteroides. With altered microbiome composition and a weakened immune system following atrazine exposure, honeybees became more susceptible to infection by the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens.

Most members of flower longicorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Lepturinae) feed on nectar and pollen of flowers as adults and wood as larvae. In some lepturines, associations with yeasts are known: female adults possess fungus-storing organs (termed mycetangia) at ovipositors, and larvae also possess such organs (termed mycetomes) in their midguts to carry the associated yeasts. Despite the high diversity of Lepturinae in the world, lepturine-yeast associations, such as the consistency of associated yeasts among the beetle's developmental stages and ecological function of yeast symbionts, have been poorly documented. Here, we investigated the yeast symbiont of the Japanese common lepturine Leptura ochraceofasciata. X-ray computed microtomography revealed that a pair of tube-like, S-shaped mycetangia was located at the basal part of the ovipositor and that a muscle bundle joined the apex of the mycetangium to spiculum ventrale of sternum VIII.

These factors lead to increased absences from school and social activities, loss of work for caregivers, and increased health care costs, thus negatively affecting children, their families, and the greater community.

In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the zygote becomes polarized and elongates in the longitudinal direction, ultimately forming the apical-basal axis of the mature plant. Despite its importance, the mechanism for this elongation remains poorly understood. Based on live-cell imaging of the zygote, we developed new image analysis methods, referred to as coordinate normalization, that appropriately fix and align positions in an image, preventing fluctuation across a temporal sequence of images. Using these methods, we discovered that the zygote elongates only at its apical tip region, similar to tip-growing cells such as pollen tubes and root hairs. We also investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of the apical tip contour of the zygote and observed that the zygote tip retains its isotropic, hemispherical apical shape during cell elongation. By looking at the elliptical fitting of the contour over time, we further discovered that the apical cell tip becomes thinner at first and then thickens, with a transient increase in growth speed that is followed by the first cell division. We performed the same series of analyses using root hairs and established that the hemispherical tip shape and the changes in growth rate associated with changes in tip size are both specific to the zygote. In summary, the Arabidopsis zygote undergoes directional elongation as a tip-growing cell, but its tip retains an unusual isotropic shape, and the manner of growth changes with the developmental stage.","03","2023","21","Plant Cell Physiol","Plant &amp; cell physiology"," Arabidopsis thaliana ; coordinate normalization; live-cell imaging; particle image velocimetry; zygote","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:42:51.843320-04:00","No","","NaT"

This stable gametogenesis enables elaborate interactions between male and female gametophytes after pollination, forming the highly successful sexual reproduction system in flowering plants. As most ovules are fertilized with a single pollen tube, the resulting genome set in the embryo and endosperm is determined in a single pattern by independent fertilization of the egg cell and central cell by two sperm cells. However, if ovules receive four sperm cells from two pollen tubes, the expected options for genome sets in the developing seeds would more than double. In wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana plants, around 5% of ovules receive two pollen tubes. Recent studies have elucidated the abnormal fertilization in supernumerary pollen tubes and sperm cells related to polytubey, polyspermy, heterofertilization, and fertilization recovery. Analyses of model plants have begun to uncover the mechanisms underlying this new pollen tube biology. Here, we review unusual fertilization phenomena and propose several breeding applications for flowering plants. These arguments contribute to the remodeling of plant reproduction, a challenging concept that alters typical plant fertilization by utilizing the current genetic toolbox.","03","2023","21","Plant Cell Physiol","Plant &amp; cell physiology","Haploid inducer; Heterofertilization; Pollen tube; Polyspermy; Polytubey; Triploid block","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:55:44.932542-04:00","No","","NaT"

In this study, we looked for evidence of local adaptation to calcareous versus siliceous soil types in two nearby Mediterranean Pinus sylvestris populations connected via pollen flow. Using a greenhouse experiment, we tested for variation in early (up to three years of age) seedling performance among open-pollinated maternal families originating from each edaphic provenance when experimentally grown on both types of natural local substrate. Although seedlings were clearly affected by the edaphic environment, exhibiting lower and slower emergence as well as higher mortality on the calcareous than in the siliceous substrate, neither the performance on each substrate nor the plasticity among substrates varied significantly with seedling edaphic provenance. We found no evidence of local adaptation to a non-extreme edaphic discontinuity over a small spatial scale, at least during early stages of seedling establishment.

In this work, we analysed the tolerance traits in a tomato line carrying a small region of the Solanum pennellii wild genome (IL12-4-SL) when grown under prolonged conditions of single and combined high temperature and water stress. When exposed to stress, IL12-4-SL showed higher heat tolerance than the cultivated line M82 at morphological, physiological, and biochemical levels. Moreover, under stress IL12-4-SL produced more flowers than M82, also characterized by higher pollen viability. In both lines, water stress negatively affected photosynthesis more than heat alone, whereas the combined stress did not further exacerbate the negative impacts of drought on this trait. Despite an observed decrease in carbon fixation, the quantum yield of PSII linear electron transport in IL12-4-SL was not affected by stress, thereby indicating that photochemical processes other than CO<sub>2</sub> fixation acted to maintain the electron chain in oxidized state and prevent photodamage. The ability of IL12-4-SL to tolerate abiotic stress was also related to the intrinsic ability of this line to accumulate ascorbic acid. The data collected in this study clearly indicate improved tolerance to single and combined abiotic stress for IL12-4-SL, making this line a promising one for cultivation in a climate scenario characterized by frequent and long-lasting heatwaves and low rainfall.","04","2023","04","Plant Biol (Stuttg)","Plant biology (Stuttgart, Germany)","Combined stress; L-ascorbic acid; drought; heat stress; tomato; wild species","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:23:09.445325-04:00","No","","NaT"

Downregulation of <i>SlMYB72</i> delayed tapetum degradation and inhibited autophagy in tomato anther. Overexpression of <i>SlMYB72</i> led to abnormal pollen development and delayed tapetum degradation. Expression levels of some autophagy-related genes (ATGs) were decreased in <i>SlMYB72</i> downregulated plants and increased in overexpression plants. SlMYB72 was directly bound to ACCAAC/ACCAAA motif of the <i>SlATG7</i> promoter and activated its expression.

We investigated the prevalence and risk factors for the development of PFAS in Japanese children and adolescents sensitised to pollen and their association with pollen-specific IgE levels. The characteristics of PFAS were investigated in patients with allergies aged 3-18 years who visited Dokkyo Medical University Hospital between January 2016 and December 2019. Specific IgE levels for alder, Japanese cedar, ragweed, and orchard grass were measured in patients sensitised to any of the pollens. Patients were categorised into preschool (G1), elementary school (G2), and middle-high school (G3) groups. Overall, 600 patients were enrolled. The prevalence of PFAS was 8.5% in G1, 20% in G2, and 36.3% in G3. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated strong associations between the risk of developing PFAS and older age (odds ratio (OR), 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.19; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), seasonal allergy rhinitis (OR, 6.93; 95% CI, 1.59-30.34; <i>P</i> = 0.010), and alder sensitisation (OR, 6.20; 95% CI, 2.66-14.49; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).

Also we performed in-silico analysis of mutated TBXA2R protein (R60L) using homology modeling. Clinical parameters like Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), FEV<sub>1</sub>/Forced vital capacity (FVC) and Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were assessed using spirometry. Patients' sensitivity was measured by skin prick test (SPT) against 16 pollen allergens. Polymerase chain reaction-based Restriction fragment length polymorphism was done for genotyping. Structural model of wild type and homology model of polymorphic TBXA2R was generated using <i>AlphaFold2</i> and MODELLER respectively. Electrostatic surface potential was calculated using APBS plugin in PyMol. Genotype frequencies differed significantly between the study groups (P=0.03). There was no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in control population (&#x3c7;2=1.56). Asthmatic patients have significantly higher frequency of rs34377097TT genotype than control subjects (P=0.03). SPT of patients showed maximum sensitivity in <i>A. indica</i> (87.68%) followed by <i>C. nusifera</i> (83.29%) and <i>C. pulcherima</i> (74.94%). Significant difference existed for pollen sensitivity in adolescent and young adult (P=0.01) and between young and old adult (P=0.0003).

Sex ratios did not deviate from 1:1 between habitat conditions except for one population in a fragmented habitat, which was female biased. The genetic diversity of adult trees and their offspring was similar in both habitat conditions. Pollen gene flow distances were similar across habitat types; however, paternity correlations were greater in fragmented than in continuous habitats. Germination rates did not differ between habitat conditions; however, progeny from fragmented habitats produced fewer leaves and had a lower foliar area, total height, and total dry biomass than progeny from continuous habitats.

However, for a more accurate assessment of pesticides effect on foraging pollinators, residues found directly on flowers are a more realistic exposure approximation. We conducted a multi-residue analysis of pesticides on pollen and nectar of melon flowers collected from five fields. The cumulative chronic oral exposure Risk Index (RI) was calculated for Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis to multiple pesticides. However, this index could underestimate the risk since sublethal or synergistic effects are not considered. Therefore, a mixture containing three of the most frequently detected pesticides in our study was tested for synergistic impact on B. terrestris micro-colonies through a chronic oral toxicity test. According to the result, pollen and nectar samples contained numerous pesticide residues, including nine insecticides, nine fungicides, and one herbicide. Eleven of those were not applied by farmers during the crop season, revealing that melon agroecosystems may be pesticide contaminated environments. The primary contributor to the chronic RI was imidacloprid and O. bircornis is at greatest risk for lethality resulting from chronic oral exposure at these sites. In the bumblebee micro-colony bioassay, dietary exposure to acetamiprid, chlorpyrifos and oxamyl at residue level concentration, showed no effects on worker mortality, drone production or drone size and no synergies were detected when pesticide mixtures were evaluated. In conclusion, our findings have significant implications for improving pesticide risk assessment schemes to guarantee pollinator conservation. In particular, bee pesticide risk assessment should not be limited to acute exposure effects to isolated active ingredients in honey bees. Instead, risk assessments should consider the long-term pesticide exposure effects in both pollen and nectar on a range of bees that reflect the diversity of natural ecosystems and the synergistic potential among pesticide formulations.","04","2023","18","Environ Pollut","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","Apis mellifera; Bumblebees; Honey bee; Mason bees; Osmia bicornis; Pesticide contamination; Risk assessment; Bees; Animals; Pesticides; Pesticide Residues; Plant Nectar; Hymenoptera; Ecosystem; Insecticides; Crops, Agricultural; Pollen","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:19:50.499081-04:00","No","","NaT"

Through protein profile identification and bioinformatics analysis, we hypothesized that heat shock cognate protein 2-like protein (HSC70L2) is the major potential allergenic protein in camphor pollen. Recombinant HSC70L2 (rHSC70L2) was expressed and purified, and a mouse model of camphor pollen allergy was established by subcutaneous injection of total camphor pollen protein extract (CPPE) and rHSC70L2. Specific IgE was found in the serum of 5 patients in response to camphor pollen and three positive bands were identified by Western blotting. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Immune dot blot and Western blot experiments confirmed that CPPE and rHSC70L2 can cause allergies in mice. Moreover, rHSC70L2 induces polarization of peripheral blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to Th2 cells in patients with respiratory allergies and mice with camphor pollen allergy.

These butterflies can be found in various locations and habitats in Central and South America, where they encounter and interact with different sources of pollen, nectar, and host plants. However, there is limited knowledge on how geographic and habitat variations affect the microbiota of these insects, and whether microbial associates play a role in their ability to exploit different habitats. To date, research on the microbial communities associated with Heliconius has mainly focused on host phylogenetic signal in microbiomes or microbiome characterization in specific communities of butterflies. In this study, we characterized the microbiomes of several species and populations of Heliconius from distant locations that represent contrasting environments. We found that the microbiota of different Heliconius species is taxonomically similar but vary in abundance. Notably, this variation is associated with a major geographic barrier-the Central Cordillera of Colombia. Additionally, we confirmed that this microbiota is not associated with pollen-feeding. Therefore, it seems likely that geography shapes the abundance of microbiota that the butterfly carries, but not the taxonomic diversity of the microbial community. Based on the current evidence, the bacterial microbiota associated with Heliconius does not appear to play a beneficial role for these butterflies.","04","2023","03","FEMS Microbiol Ecol","FEMS microbiology ecology"," Heliconius ; 16S; colombia; geography; microbial; microbiota; Animals; Butterflies; Phylogeny; Pollen; Microbiota; Geography","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:12:33.563819-04:00","No","","NaT"

This pollen is collected from honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies because neither an artificial diet nor an economical, large-scale pollen collection process from flowers is available. The provenance of honey bee-collected pollen is often unknown, and in some cases has crossed international borders. Both deformed wing virus (DWV) and the fungal pathogen Ascosphaera apis (Claussen) Olive &amp; Spiltoir (cause of chalkbrood disease); occur in honey bee-collected pollen, and infections have been observed in bumble bees. We used these pathogens as general surrogates for viruses and spore-forming fungal diseases to test the efficacy of 3 sterilization methods, and assessed whether treatment altered pollen quality for the bumble bee. Using honey bee-collected pollen spiked with known doses of DWV and A. apis, we compared gamma irradiation (GI), ozone fumigation (OZ), and ethylene oxide fumigation (EO) against an untreated positive control and a negative control. Following sterilization treatments, we tested A. apis spore viability, detected viral presence with PCR, and tested palatability to the bumble bee Bombus impatiens Cresson. We also measured bacterial growth from pollens treated with EO and GI. GI and EO outperformed OZ treatment in pathogen suppression. EO had the highest sterilizing properties under commercial conditions and retained palatability and supported bee development better than other treatments. These results suggest that EO sterilization reduces pathogen risks while retaining pollen quality as a food source for rearing bumble bees.","03","2023","17","J Econ Entomol","Journal of economic entomology","chalkbrood; deformed wing virus; ethylene oxide; irradiation; ozone","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:20:40.211372-04:00","No","","NaT"

A gene encoding pectin methylesterase (GhPME21) was found to be predominantly expressed in the developing stamens of cotton but was significantly down-regulated in ms1 stamens. The tapetal layer of GhPME21 interfered lines (GhPME21i) was significantly thickened compared to that of WT at the early stage; anther compartment morphology of GhPME21i lines was abnormal, and the microspore wall was broken at the middle stage; Alexander staining showed that the pollen grains of GhPME21i lines differed greatly in volume at the late stage. The mature pollen surfaces of GhPME21i lines were deposited with discontinuous and broken sheets and prickles viewed under SEM. Fewer pollen tubes were observed to germinate in vitro in GhPME21i lines, while tiny of those in vivo were found to elongate to the ovary. The seeds harvested from GhPME21i lines as pollination donors were dry and hollow. The changes of phenotypes in GhPME21i lines at various stages illustrated that the GhPME21 gene played a vital role in the development of cotton stamens and controlled plant fertility by affecting stamen development, pollen germination, and pollen tube elongation.

This study aimed to quantify the clinical effect of ozone and pollen double exposure (DE). We tested whether ozone impairs barrier-related skin physiology and mucosal functions under double exposure with pollen ozone in grass pollen-allergic patients versus healthy controls. This case-control study included 8 grass pollen-allergic patients and 8 non-allergic healthy subjects exposed to grass pollen and ozone in the GA&#xb2;LEN pollen chamber, comparing shorter and longer DE duration. Non-invasive skin physiological parameters were assessed, including stratum corneum hydration, skin redness, surface pH, and basal transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as a parameter for epidermal barrier function. The subjects' general well-being, bronchial, nasal, and ocular symptoms were documented. Skin physiology tests revealed that DE in allergic patients deteriorates the epidermal barrier function, increases the surface pH and skin redness. DE significantly induced nasal secretion in pollen-allergic versus healthy subjects, which was more pronounced with longer DE. The general well-being was significantly impaired under DE versus pollen or ozone alone, with a negative influence of DE-duration. No relevant bronchial symptoms were recorded. Skin physiology and nasal mucosal symptoms and are negatively affected by ozone and grass pollen DE in allergic patients.

The mutant osuge1 protein lacked UDP-glucose epimerase activity, resulting in higher UDP-Gal content and lower UDP-Glc levels in the osuge1 mutant compared with the wild type. Interestingly, we discovered that OsUGE1 participates in the TIP2/bHLH142-TDR-EAT1/DTD transcriptional regulatory cascade involved in tapetum degradation, in which TIP2 and TDR regulate the expression of OsUGE1 while OsUGE1 regulates the expression of EAT1. In addition, we found that OsUGE1 regulates the expression of its own gene by directly binding to an E-box element in the OsUGE1 promoter.

MASK-air has enabled the comparison of reported symptoms among patients treated vs. not-treated with AIT. MASK-air has also allowed for the development of combined symptom-medication scores that can be used as endpoints for AIT trials. AllergyMonitor has identified that mobile technology can improve adherence to AIT and is set to support the prescription of AIT for patients with allergic rhinitis by a more precise identification of the pollen season.

However, pollen is also a unique vehicle for viral spread. Pollen-associated plant viruses reside on the outside or inside of pollen grains, infect susceptible individuals through vertical or horizontal infection pathways, and can decrease plant fitness. These viruses are transferred with pollen between plants by pollinator vectors as they forage for floral resources; thus, pollen-associated viral spread is mediated by floral and pollen grain phenotypes and pollinator traits, much like pollination. Most of what is currently known about pollen-associated viruses was discovered through infection and transmission experiments in controlled settings, usually involving one virus and one plant species of agricultural or horticultural interest. In this review, we first provide an updated, comprehensive list of the recognized pollen-associated viruses. Then, we summarize virus, plant, pollinator vector, and landscape traits that can affect pollen-associated virus transmission,&#xa0;infection, and distribution. Next, we highlight the consequences of plant-pollinator-virus interactions that emerge in complex communities of co-flowering plants and pollinator vectors, such as pollen-associated virus spread between plant species and viral jumps from plant to pollinator hosts.

We have shown previously that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> VPS45 interacts with the SYP61/SYP41/VTI12 SNARE complex, which locates on the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network (TGN). It is required for SYP41 stability, and it functions in cargo trafficking to the vacuole and in cell expansion. It is also required for correct auxin distribution during gravitropism and lateral root growth. As <i>vps45</i> knockout mutation is lethal in Arabidopsis, we identified a mutant, <i>vps45-3</i>, with a point mutation in the <i>VPS45</i> gene causing a serine 284-to-phenylalanine substitution. The VPS45-3 protein is stable and maintains interaction with SYP61 and SYP41. However, <i>vps45-3</i> plants display severe growth defects with significantly reduced organ and cell size, similar to <i>vps45</i> RNAi transgenic lines that have reduced VPS45 protein levels. Root hair and pollen tube elongation, both processes of tip growth, are highly compromised in <i>vps45-3</i>. Mutant root hairs are shorter and thicker than those of wild-type plants, and are wavy. These root hairs have vacuolar defects, containing many small vacuoles, compared with WT root hairs with a single large vacuole occupying much of the cell volume. Pollen tubes were also significantly shorter in <i>vps45-3</i> compared to WT.

Several studies have explained the need to increase conservation efforts for bumblebees due to climate change, but studies on the impact of climate change on pollination behavior of bumblebees have been limited. The present study investigated the effect of elevated temperatures on the survival and physiology of bumblebees. The behavioral changes in flight ability and pollen collection were also determined. We found that elevated temperature affects the survival rate and appetite of bumblebees. Gene expression analysis suggested that the energy metabolic pathway tends to involve anaerobic respiration during heat stress. The energy produced is mainly used to maintain essential physiological functions, such as expression of heat shock proteins and conversion of peroxides to harmless molecules. Energy distributed to flight muscles is reduced during heat stress, resulting in lower wing beating frequency. In addition, the flight path of bumblebees is shortened during heat stress, thereby further contributing to reduced pollen collection. These results demonstrate that elevated temperatures cause detrimental effects to bumblebees and can also potentially reduce crop production.","04","2023","04","Insect Biochem Mol Biol","Insect biochemistry and molecular biology","Bumblebees; Climate change; Energy metabolic; Heat stress; Bees; Animals; Temperature; Pollination; Energy Metabolism; Behavior, Animal; Pollen","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:53:59.123763-04:00","No","","NaT"

Immunoblotting was performed with extracts from cow dander, cow body fluids (urine and saliva), bull urine, and 17 sera from immunotherapy-untreated CEA patients. The mean age of the patients was 44 years, with a higher incidence in cattle farmers. Rhinoconjunctivitis occurred in 100% of cases, with 35% having monosensitization to cow epithelium. Sera from most patients detected a 20-kDa IgE-binding band in cow dander, cow saliva, cow urine, and bull urine, corresponding to the major allergen Bos d 2 (bovine lipocalin). In 70% of the patients, a 25-kDa band was detected in cow and bull urine extracts, whose identification by mass spectrometry and investigation with protein databases led to the identification of a Bos taurus lipocalin (UniProt protein ID: A0A3Q1LGU7_BOVIN). CEA should be considered in patients exposed to cattle and as a cause of occupational disease. The IgE immunodetection revealed sensitization to a protein present in cow and bull urine (odorant-binding protein) not previously described.","03","2023","15","Int Arch Allergy Immunol","International archives of allergy and immunology","Allergy; Cow epithelium; Major allergen; Occupational allergy; Sensitization","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 19:07:03.849229-04:00","No","","NaT"
"249","Systemic development of wheat-Thinopyrum elongatum translocation lines and their deployment in wheat breeding for Fusarium head blight resistance.","36919201","10.1111/tpj.16190","Fusarium head blight (FHB), mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum, is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) around the world. FHB causes significant yield losses and reduces grain quality. The lack of resistance resources is a major bottleneck for wheat FHB resistance breeding. As a wheat relative, Thinopyrum elongatum contains many genes that can be used for wheat improvement. Although the novel gene Fhb-7EL was mapped on chromosome 7EL of Th. elongatum, successful transfer of the FHB resistance gene into commercial wheat varieties has not been reported. In this study, we developed 836 wheat-Th. elongatum translocation lines of various types by irradiating the pollen of the wheat-Th.&#xa0;elongatum addition line CS-7EL at the flowering stage, among which 81 were identified as resistant to FHB. By backcrossing the FHB-resistant lines with the main cultivar Jimai 22, three wheat-Th. elongatum translocation lines, Zhongke 1878, Zhongke 166, and Zhongke 545, were successfully applied in wheat breeding without yield penalty. Combining karyotype and phenotype analyses, we mapped the Fhb-7EL gene to the distal end of chromosome 7EL. Five molecular markers linked with the FHB resistance interval were developed, which facilitates molecular marker-assisted breeding. Altogether, we successfully applied alien chromatin with FHB resistance from Th. elongatum in wheat breeding without yield penalty. These newly developed FHB-resistant wheat-Th. elongatum translocation lines, Zhongke 1878, Zhongke 166, and Zhongke 545, can be used as novel resistance resources for wheat breeding.","04","2023","03","Plant J","The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology","Fusarium head blight; Thinopyrum elongatum; chromosome; translocation line; wheat breeding","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 19:04:53.282363-04:00","No","","NaT"

Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited trait that produces abnormal pollen during anther development, which is commonly seen in cruciferous vegetables. However, the molecular mechanism of Chinese cabbage CMS is not clear. In this study, the metabolome and hormone profiles of Chinese cabbage male sterile line (CCR20000) and sterile maintainer line (CCR20001) were analyzed in flower buds during normal stamen development and abnormal stamen development, respectively. A total of 556 metabolites were detected based on UPLC-MS/MS detection platform and database search, and the changes of hormones such as auxin, cytokinins, abscisic acid, jasmonates, salicylic acid, gibberellin acid and ethylene were analyzed. The results showed that compared with the male fertile line (MF), the male sterile line (MS) significantly decreased the content of flavonoids and phenolamides metabolites in the stamen dysplasia stage, accompanied by a large accumulation of glucosinolate metabolites. Meanwhile, the contents of GA9, GA20, IBA, tZ and other hormones in MS were significantly lower than those in MF strains. Further, by comparing the metabolome changes of MF and MS during stamen dysplasia, it was found that flavonoid metabolites and amino acid metabolites were distinctly different. These results suggest that flavonoids, phenolamides and glucosinolate metabolites may be closely related to the sterility of MS strains. This study provides an effective basis for further research on the molecular mechanism of CMS in Chinese cabbage.","03","2023","09","BMC Plant Biol","BMC plant biology","Chinese cabbage; Cytoplasmic male sterility; Metabolome; Chromatography, Liquid; Glucosinolates; Plant Infertility; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Flavonoids; Brassica","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:22:25.566061-04:00","No","","NaT"

Due to climate change, the atmospheric content of trigger factors such as pollens and moulds increase and induce rhinitis and asthma in sensitized patients with IgE-mediated allergic reactions.Pollen allergy is frequently used to evaluate the relationship between air pollution and allergic respiratory diseases. Pollen allergens trigger the release of immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators and accelerate the onset of sensitization to respiratory allergens in predisposed children and adults. Lightning storms during pollen seasons can exacerbate respiratory allergy and asthma not only in adults but also in children with pollinosis. In this study, we have focalized the trigger (chemical and biologic) factors of outdoor air pollution. Environmental pollution and climate change have harmful effects on human health, particularly on respiratory system, with frequent impact on social systems.Climate change is characterized by physic meteorological events inducing increase of production and emission of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into the atmosphere. Allergenic plants produce more pollen as a response to high atmospheric levels of CO 2 . Climate change also affects extreme atmospheric events such as heat waves, droughts, thunderstorms, floods, cyclones and hurricanes. These climate events, in particular thunderstorms during pollen seasons, can increase the intensity of asthma attacks in pollinosis patients. Climate change has important effects on the start and pathogenetic aspects of hypersensitivity of pollen allergy. Climate change causes an increase in the production of pollen and a change in the aspects increasing their allergenic properties. Through the effects of climate change, plant growth can be altered so that the new pollen produced are modified affecting more the human health. The need for public education and adoption of governmental measures to prevent environmental pollution and climate change are urgent. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, chemical and biologic contributors to air pollution are of critical importance.

MYB (v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) transcription factors play an important role in everything from stress resistance to plant growth and development. However, the MYB family of chrysanthemums has not been the subject of a detailed bioinformatics and expression investigation. In this study, we examined 324 CnMYB transcription factors from Chrysanthemum nankingense genome data, which contained 122 Cn1R-MYB, 183 CnR2R3-MYB, 12 Cn3R-MYB, 2 Cn4R-MYB, and 5 atypical CnMYB. The protein motifs and classification of CnMYB transcription factors were analyzed. Among them, motifs 1, 2, 3, and 4 were found to encode the MYB DNA-binding domain in R2R3-MYB proteins, while in other-MYB proteins, the motifs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 encode the MYB DNA-binding domain. Among all CnMYBs, 44 genes were selected due to the presence of CpG islands, while methylation is detected in three genes, including CnMYB9, CnMYB152, and CnMYB219. We analyzed the expression levels of each CnMYB gene in ray floret, disc floret, flower bud, leaf, stem, and root tissues. Based on phylogenetic analysis and gene expression analysis, three genes appeared likely to control cellulose and lignin synthesis in stem tissue, and 16 genes appeared likely to regulate flowering time, anther, pollen development, and flower color. Fifty-one candidate genes that may be involved in stress response were identified through phylogenetic, stress-responseve motif of promoter, and qRT-PCR analyses. According to genes expression levels under stress conditions, six CnMYB genes (CnMYB9, CnMYB172, CnMYB186, CnMYB199, CnMYB219, and CnMYB152) were identified as key stress-responsive genes.

However, available evidence for such relationships remain idiosyncratic, due to different taxonomic, geographical and time scales. The Palearctic genus Helianthemum shows the highest diversity of the family Cistaceae in terms of breeding systems, floral traits and environmental conditions, resulting from three recent evolutionary radiations occurred since the Late Miocene. Here, we investigate the tempo and mode of evolution of floral morphology in the genus, and its link with species diversification and environmental niche divergence. We quantified eighteen floral traits from 83 taxa and applied phylogenetic comparative methods using a robust phylogenetic framework based on genotyping by sequencing data. The results revealed three different floral morphologies, putatively related to three different breeding systems: (i) type I, characterized by small flowers without herkogamy and low pollen to ovule ratio; (ii) type II, represented by large flowers with approach herkogamy and intermediate pollen to ovule ratio; and (iii) type III, featured by small flowers with reverse herkogamy and the highest pollen to ovule ratio. Each morphology has been highly conserved across each radiation and has evolved independently of species diversification and ecological niche divergence. The combined results of trait, niche and species diversification ultimately recovered a pattern of potentially non-adaptive radiations in Helianthemum and highlight the idea that evolutionary radiations can be decoupled from floral morphology evolution even in lineages that diversified in heterogeneous environments as the Mediterranean Basin.

"257","Live Imaging of Arabidopsis Pollen Tube Reception and Double Fertilization Using the Semi-In Vitro Cum Septum Method.","36912546","10.3791/65156","In flowering plants, the growth and guidance of the pollen tube (male gametophyte) within the pistil and the reception of the pollen tube by the female gametophyte are essential for double fertilization and subsequent seed development. The interactions between male and female gametophytes during pollen tube reception culminate in pollen tube rupture and the release of two sperm cells to effect double fertilization. As pollen tube growth and double fertilization are deeply hidden within the tissues of the flower, this process is difficult to observe in vivo. A semi-in vitro (SIV) method for the live-cell imaging of fertilization in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has been developed and implemented in several investigations. These studies have helped to elucidate the fundamental features of how the fertilization process occurs in flowering plants and which cellular and molecular changes occur during the interaction of the male and female gametophytes. However, because these live cell imaging experiments involve the excision of individual ovules, they are limited to a low number of observations per imaging session, making this approach tedious and very time-consuming. Among other technical difficulties, a failure of the pollen tubes to fertilize the ovules in vitro is&#xa0;often reported, which severely confounds such analyses. Here, a detailed video protocol for the imaging of pollen tube reception and fertilization in an automated and high-throughput manner is provided, allowing for up to 40 observations of pollen tube reception and rupture per imaging session. Coupled with the use of genetically encoded biosensors and marker lines, this method enables the generation of large sample sizes with a reduced time investment. Nuances and critical points of the technique, including flower staging, dissection, medium preparation, and imaging, are clearly detailed in video format to facilitate future research on the dynamics of pollen tube guidance, reception, and double fertilization.","03","2023","15","J Vis Exp","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","Arabidopsis; Pollen Tube; Seeds; Fertilization; Arabidopsis Proteins; Ovule","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:20:59.368669-04:00","No","","NaT"

Transcriptomic analysis revealed that, following HS, genes related to carbohydrate metabolic processes were expressed and regulated differentially in the anthers of GS2 and ZH11. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in chloroplast development and photosynthesis, lipid metabolism, and key transcription factors, including eight male sterile genes, were inhibited by HS to a greater extent in GS2 than in ZH11. Interestingly, pre-mRNAs of <i>OsGRF4</i>, and a group of essential genes involved in development and fertilization, were differentially spliced in the anthers of GS2 and ZH11.

Plants with relatively low levels of vagility have exhibited high genetic divergence between the BCP and Continental mainland. Brahea armata (Arecaceae) is a palm species inhabiting the northern part of the BCP and Sonora; its distribution occurs in isolated oases of vegetation. We aimed to evaluate the influence of the formation of the BCP on the genetic structure of B. armata using nuclear microsatellites and chloroplast markers (cpDNA) to compare patterns of genetic diversity and structure with previous published studies. Because gene flow through seeds is usually more limited compared to pollen flow, we expect to find stronger genetic structure at (cpDNA) than at nuclear markers. Moreover, larger genetic structure might also be explained by the smaller effective population size of cpDNA. We analyzed six microsatellite markers and two cpDNA regions. The main results indicated high levels of genetic differentiation among isolated populations located in the BCP, while low genetic differentiation was found between southern populations of the BCP and Sonora, suggesting long distance gene flow. In contrast, chloroplast markers indicated high levels of genetic structure between BCP and Sonora populations, suggesting asymmetrical gene flow between pollen (measured by nuclear microsatellites) and seed (cpDNA markers). This study provides valuable information on genetic diversity of B. armata that can be relevant for conservation and management; and develops microsatellites markers that can be transferred to other Brahea species.","04","2023","26","J Plant Res","Journal of plant research","Gene flow; Genetic structure; Microsatellite; Vicariance; cpDNA; Gene Flow; Arecaceae; Mexico; DNA, Chloroplast; Genetic Structures; Genetic Variation; Microsatellite Repeats","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:39:52.883758-04:00","No","","NaT"

This review focuses on their use against polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)-related infertility. A systematic search of electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar was conducted from their inceptions up to November 2022.

Up to now, systematic research on the autotetraploid of sour jujube (<i>Ziziphus acidojujuba</i> Cheng et Liu) has not been reported. 'Zhuguang' is the first released autotetraploid sour jujube induced with colchicine. The objective of this study was to compare the differences in the morphological, cytological characteristics, and fruit quality between diploid and autotetraploid. Compared with the original diploid, 'Zhuguang' showed dwarf phenotypes and decreased tree vigor. The sizes of the flowers, pollen, stomata, and leaves of 'Zhuguang' were larger. Perceptible darker green leaves were observed in 'Zhuguang' trees owing to increased chlorophyll contents, which led to higher photosynthesis efficiency and bigger fruit. The pollen activities and the contents of ascorbic acid, titratable acid, and soluble sugar in the autotetraploid were lower than those in diploids. However, the cyclic adenosine monophosphate content in autotetraploid fruit was significantly higher. The sugar/acid ratio of autotetraploid fruit was higher than that of diploid fruit, which made the autotetraploid fruit taste different and better. The results indicated that the autotetraploid we generated in sour jujube could greatly meet the goals of our multi-objective optimized breeding strategies for improving sour jujube, which includes tree dwarfing, increased photosynthesis efficiency, and better nutrient values and flavors as well as more bioactive compounds. Needless to say, the autotetraploid can also serve as material for generating valuable triploids or other types of polyploids and are also instrumental in studying the evolution of both sour jujube and Chinese jujube (<i>Ziziphus jujuba</i> Mill.).","03","2023","14","Plants (Basel)","Plants (Basel, Switzerland)","autotetraploid; characteristic; fruit quality; polyploidization","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:42:49.458517-04:00","No","","NaT"

In this study, different concentrations (0, 3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30 g/L) of glyphosate were applied to <i>CP4-EPSPS</i> transgenic sea island cotton Xinchang 5 in 2021 and 2022 at Korla, with 15 g/L glyphosate chosen as the suitable concentration. By comparing the paraffin sections of 2-24 mm anthers in the 15 g/L glyphosate treatment group with those in the water control group, we showed that the key period of anther abortion after glyphosate treatment was the formation and development of tetrads, which corresponded to 8-9 mm buds. Transcriptome sequencing analysis of the treated and control anthers revealed a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in phytohormone-related pathways, in particular abscisic acid response and regulation pathways. Additionally, after treatment with 15 g/L of glyphosate, there was a significant increase in the amount of abscisic acid in the anthers in the 8-9 mm buds. Further analysis of the differential expression of abscisic acid response and regulatory genes, an abscisic acid response gene <i>GbTCP14</i> (<i>Gbar_A11G003090</i>) was identified, which was significantly upregulated in buds with 15 g/L glyphosate treatment than the control, and it could be a key candidate gene for the subsequent research involving male sterility induced by glyphosate in sea island cotton.","03","2023","14","Plants (Basel)","Plants (Basel, Switzerland)","abscisic acid response; glyphosate; male sterility; sea Island cotton","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:15:53.322028-04:00","No","","NaT"

However, the intensification of agriculture, urbanization, changes to the topography, and harsh environmental conditions are currently impacting foraging sites due to habitat loss and scarcity of food resources. Thus, this study aimed to assess honey bee preference for various pollen substitute diet compositions. Bee colonies perform poorly because of specific environmental problems, which ultimately result in pollen scarcity. Pollen substitutes located at various distance from the bee hive were also investigated in addition to determining the preferences of honey bees for various pollen substitute diets. The local honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera jemenitica</i>) colonies and different diets (four main treatments, namely, chickpea flour, maize flour, sorghum flour, wheat flour; each flour was further mixed with cinnamon powder, turmeric powder, flour only, flour mixed with both cinnamon and turmeric powder) were used. Bee pollen was used as a control. The best performing pollen substitutes were further placed at 10, 25, and 50 m distances from the apiary. Maximum bee visits were observed on bee pollen (210 &#xb1; 25.96) followed by chickpea flour only (205 &#xb1; 19.32). However, there was variability in the bee visits to the different diets (F (16,34) = 17.91; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). In addition, a significant difference in diet consumption was observed in control (576 &#xb1; 58.85 g) followed by chickpea flour only (463.33 &#xb1; 42.84 g), compared to rest of the diets (F (16,34) = 29.75; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).

Honey bees preferred to visit the food source that was closest to the hive. This study should be very helpful for beekeepers in supplementing their bee colonies when there is a shortage or unavailability of pollens, and it is much better to keep the food source near the apiary.

We adopted Hypochaeris radicata as a model species to investigate the functional morphology of the typical floral feature of Asteraceae, a pollen-bearing style.

Furthermore, pollen mother cells failed to progress normally into meiosis and pollen mitosis, a trait mostly observed in apomictic <i>Malus</i> plants. The expression levels of meiosis-related genes were upregulated in apomictic plants. Our findings indicate that our simple method of detecting pollen abortion could be used to identify apple plants that are capable of apomictic reproduction.","03","2023","10","Front Plant Sci","Frontiers in plant science","apomeiosis; apomixis; apple; pollen abortion; transcriptome analysis","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:49:26.896453-04:00","No","","NaT"

Among these organs, staminodes are morphologically diverse structures that have lost the ability to produce pollen, but in some instances, they produce fertile pollen grains. In the family Cactaceae staminodes are uncommon and range from simple linear to flat to spatulate structures, but studies describing their structural attributes are scanty. This study highlights the advantages of synchrotron radiation for sample preparation and as a research tool for plant biology. It describes the internal morphology of floral parts, particularly stamen, tepal, and staminode in the Plains Prickly Pear Cactus, Opuntia polyacantha, using synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-&#x3bc;CT). It also shows the different anatomical features in reconstructed three-dimensional imaging of reproductive parts and discuss the advantages of the segmentation method to detect and characterize the configuration and intricate patterns of vascular networks and associated structures of tepal and androecial parts applying SR-&#x3bc;CT. This powerful technology led to substantial improvements in terms of resolution allowing a more comprehensive understanding of the anatomical organization underlying the vasculature of floral parts and inception of staminodes in O. polyacantha. Tepal and androecial parts have uniseriate epidermis enclosing loose mesophyll with mucilage secretory ducts, lumen, and scattered vascular bundles. Cryptic underlying structural attributes provide evidence of a vascularized pseudo-anther conjoint with tepals. The undefined contours of staminodial appendages (pseudo-anther) amalgamated to the tepals' blurred boundaries suggest that staminodes originate from tepals, a developmental pattern supporting the fading border model of floral organ identity for angiosperms.","03","2023","10","Protoplasma","Protoplasma","Computed tomography; Pseudo-anther; Stamen; Staminode; Synchrotron; Tepaloid staminode","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:22:22.379686-04:00","No","","NaT"

In this study, the pollen study was intended to assess the taxonomic value for Asteraceous taxa growing on the Sikaram Mountain Pak-Afghan border. Both microscopic techniques (LM and SEM) play a significant role in the identification and classification of herbaceous species of Asteraceae for their taxonomic and systematic implication. Pollen was observed and measured for the 15 species of Asteraceae. For investigated taxa 15 pollen characters with size, shape, polar view, pollen type, aperture orientation, and exine sculpturing in the eurypalynous pollen. Consequently, the pollen grains are usually Tricolporate, triangular to circular in polar view, while, the shape of pollen varies from subulate, oblate, and prolate along with prolate to spheroidal whereas, sculpturing also varies from Scabrate to micro reticulate, echino-perforate, Scabrate to echinate, echinate to granulate and echinate were observed.

Classroom microbial and metabolite exposure in vacuumed dust was characterized by PacBio long-read amplicon sequencing, quantitative PCR and LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics. Our findings indicate a similar microbial association pattern between AR and NAR. The richness in Gammaproteobacteria was negatively associated with AR and NAR symptoms, whereas total fungal richness was positively associated with AR and NAR symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>Brasilonema bromeliae</i> and <i>Aeromonas enteropelogenes</i> were negatively associated with AR and NAR, and <i>Deinococcus</i> was positively associated with AR and NAR (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).

Nasal symptom scores were recorded. Peripheral M2 macrophages were investigated according to cell surface markers, and M2-associated cytokine/chemokine release in serum and nasal secretion were assessed. In vitro pollen stimulation tests were performed, and polarized macrophage subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. Compared to baseline, the percentage of peripheral CD163+ M2 macrophages in CD14+ monocytes increased during the pollen season (p &lt; 0.001) and at the end of treatment (p = 0.004) in the SLIT group. The percentage of CD206+CD86- M2 cells in M2 macrophages during the pollen season was higher than that at baseline and at the end of SLIT. On the other hand, the percentage of CD206-CD86+ M2 cells in M2 macrophages significantly increased at the end of treatment in the SLIT group compared to baseline (p = 0.049), the peak pollen period (p = 0.017), and the placebo group (p = 0.0023).

An important aspect of this study is birch pollen, which is a problem for allergy sufferers, and due to a variety of environmental conditions, its allergenicity may increase. Among the organs studied, inflorescences deserve attention, which, as seen from an overview of the literature, are analysed for the content of heavy metals for the first time in this study. This paper investigated the relationship between antioxidant properties and the content of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni and Cr) as the plant's response to stress, taking into account both the vegetative and generative organs of the tree Betula pendula. While studying the accumulation of elements in individual organs, the research was extended to include the aspect of different environmental conditions, reflected in two soil types of differing physicochemical properties: sandy and silty soils. In order to thoroughly analyse the transport of the studied heavy metals from the soil to individual organs (leaves, inflorescences and pollen), ecotoxicological indicators were used. A modified translocation factor (TF) index into sTF (sap translocation factor) was presented as a novelty in research, calculated based on the content of selected heavy metals in the sap flowing to individual birch organs. This allowed for a more complete description of the transport of elements in the aerial parts of plants, indicating the accumulation of zinc and cadmium, especially in leaves. Among the studied environmental conditions which may affect the accumulation of heavy metals, sandy soil is of particular significance, conditioning lower pH values, among other things. However, analysis of the reaction of birch to the conditions of the soil environment and the content of heavy metals, based on antioxidant properties, demonstrated an evident reaction to stress, but without an unambiguous response among the studied vegetative and generative organs. As birch is a plant with wide utility values, monitoring studies are advisable to exclude the risk of accumulation of heavy metals in its organs, and for this purpose it may be useful to use the sTF indicator and assess the antioxidant potential.","03","2023","08","J Biol Eng","Journal of biological engineering","Antioxidants; New ecotoxicological indicator; Silver birch; Stress","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:39:17.210062-04:00","No","","NaT"

Generally, CMS involves mitochondrial genomes interacting with the nuclear genome, while GMS is caused by nuclear genes alone. Male sterility is regulated by multilevel mechanisms in which non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs), which have been proven to be critical elements. The development of high-throughput sequencing technology offers new opportunities to evaluate the genetic mechanism of ncRNAs in plant male sterility. In this review, we summarize the critical ncRNAs that regulate gene expression in ways dependent on or independent of hormones, which involve the differentiation of the stamen primordia, degradation of the tapetum, formation of microspores, and the release of pollen. In addition, the key mechanisms of the miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA interaction networks mediating male sterility in plants are elaborated. We present a different perspective on exploring the ncRNA-mediated regulatory pathways that control CMS in plants and create male-sterile lines through hormones or genome editing. A refined understanding of the ncRNA regulatory mechanisms in plant male sterility for the development of new sterile lines would be conducive to improve hybridization breeding.","03","2023","07","Front Plant Sci","Frontiers in plant science","long non-coding RNA (lncRNA); male sterility; microRNA (miRNA); mitochondrial gene; plant hormone","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:52:07.897636-04:00","No","","NaT"

Maize is one of the versatile crops grown over different agro-climatic conditions. However, it is significantly sensitive to heat stress, especially during the reproductive phase. The heat stress tolerance mechanism is yet to be elucidated at the reproductive stage. Thus, the present study focused on identifying transcriptional changes in two inbreds, LM 11 (sensitive to HS) and CML 25 (tolerant to HS), under intense heat stress at 42&#xb0;C during the reproductive stage from three tissues viz. flag leaf, tassel, and ovule. Samples from each inbred were collected after 5 days of pollinations for RNA isolation. Six cDNA libraries were constructed from three separate tissues of LM 11 and CML 25 and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. A total of 2,164 (1127 up-regulated and 1037 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with 1151, 451, and 562 DEGs in comparisons of LM 11 and CML 25, corresponding to a leaf, pollen, and ovule, respectively. Functional annotated DEGs associated with transcription factors (TFs) <i>viz</i>. AP2, MYB, WRKY, PsbP, bZIP, and NAM, heat shock proteins (HSP20, HSP70, and HSP101/ClpB), as well as genes related to photosynthesis (PsaD &amp; PsaN), antioxidation (APX and CAT) and polyamines (Spd and Spm). KEGG pathways analyses showed that the metabolic overview pathway and secondary metabolites biosynthesis pathway, with the involvement of 264 and 146 genes, respectively, were highly enriched in response to heat stress. Notably, the expression changes of the most common HS-responsive genes were typically much more significant in CML 25, which might explain why CML 25 is more heat tolerant. Seven DEGs were common in leaf, pollen, and ovule; and involved in the polyamines biosynthesis pathway. Their exact role in maize heat stress response would warrant further studies.

In this study, we investigate the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation of the major birch and grass pollen allergens Bet&#x2009;v&#x2009;1 and Phl&#x2009;p&#x2009;5, and how the physiological oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>-</sup>) changes the TLR4 activation through protein nitration and the formation of protein dimers and higher oligomers. Of the two allergens, Bet&#x2009;v&#x2009;1 exhibited no TLR4 activation, but we found TLR4 activation of Phl&#x2009;p&#x2009;5, which increased after modification with ONOO<sup>-</sup> and may play a role in the sensitization against this grass pollen allergen. We attribute the TLR4 activation mainly to the two-domain structure of Phl&#x2009;p&#x2009;5 which may promote TLR4 dimerization and activation. The enhanced TLR4 signaling of the modified allergen indicates that the ONOO<sup>-</sup>-induced modifications affect relevant protein-receptor interactions.

"296","Evolution Of Immunotherapy Against Pollen Allergy.","36872361","10.2174/1389203724666230303091754","Allergic diseases have increased worldwide during the last century and are a major disease burden globally. Several substances can induce allergic sensitization and elicit allergic symptoms in sensitized individuals. Pollen grains are one of the main causes of allergic rhinitis and asthma, and the prevalence of different pollen species depends on the climate, geographical regions, flora, and season. In addition to avoiding exposure to pollens, anti-allergic drugs are commonly used to mitigate the symptoms of allergies. However, these drugs must be administered repeatedly as long as the symptoms prevail, usually life-long. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is currently the only disease-modifying approach that can prevent the natural progression of the disease (also known as an allergic march), provide a long-lasting therapeutic effect, and prevent the worsening of the symptoms and the occurrence of new sensitizations in allergic individuals. Since the pioneering clinical studies conducted more than 100 years ago using subcutaneously administered pollen extract to treat hay fever, significant advances have been made in the field of AIT. Starting from this pioneering approach, in this review, we have discussed the evolution of the products used for AIT with particular emphasis on pollen allergoids, the chemically modified pollen extracts characterized by lower allergenicity and comparable immunogenicity, and the different routes of administration used for AIT.","03","2023","05","Curr Protein Pept Sci","Current protein &amp; peptide science","adjuvant; allergen immunotherapy; allergic march; allergy; monomeric allergoids; pollen extracts; polymeric allergoids","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:39:19.364374-04:00","No","","NaT"

The primary outcome of AR prescriptions from a retrospective cohort study (REAl-world effeCtiveness in allergy immunoTherapy; 2007-2017) was assessed across prespecified AIT subgroups in subjects with AR with and without AIT prescriptions (controls). Safety was assessed as anaphylaxis for 2 days or less of the first AIT prescription. Subgroup follow-up continued until samples were fewer than 200 subjects. Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and SLIT tablets showed similarly greater reductions in AR prescriptions than controls (SCIT vs SLIT tablets: year 3, P&#xa0;= .15; year 5, P&#xa0;= .43). Comparably greater reductions in AR prescriptions were observed for grass- and house dust mite-specific AIT than for controls, but significantly smaller reductions were observed for tree-specific AIT (tree vs house dust mite, and vs grass: years 3 and 5, P&#xa0;&lt; .0001).

Plant materials constitute the basis, among others, for linking a suspect or object to a crime scene or a victim, confirming or not confirming an alibi, determining the post-mortem interval, and determining the origin of food/object. Forensic botany entails field work, knowledge of plants, understanding ecosystem processes, and a basis understaning of geoscience. In this study, experiments with mammal cadavers were conducted to determine the occurence of an event. The simplest criterion characterising botanical evidence is its size. Therefore, macroremains include whole plants or their larger fragments (e.g. tree bark, leaves, seeds, prickles, and thorns), whereas microscopic evidence includes palynomorphs (spores and pollen grains), diatoms, and tissues. Botanical methods allow for an analysis to be repeated multiple times and the test material is easy to collect in the field.

"299","The triticale mature pollen and stigma proteomes - assembling the proteins for a productive encounter.","36870675","10.1016/j.jprot.2023.104867","Triticeae crops are major contributors to global food production and ensuring their capacity to reproduce and generate seeds is critical. However, despite their importance our knowledge of the proteins underlying Triticeae reproduction is severely lacking and this is not only true of pollen and stigma development, but also of their pivotal interaction. When the pollen grain and stigma are brought together they have each accumulated the proteins required for their intended meeting and accordingly studying their mature proteomes is bound to reveal proteins involved in their diverse and complex interactions. Using triticale as a Triticeae representative, gel-free shotgun proteomics was used to identify 11,533 and 2977 mature stigma and pollen proteins respectively. These datasets, by far the largest to date, provide unprecedented insights into the proteins participating in Triticeae pollen and stigma development and interactions. The study of the Triticeae stigma has been particularly neglected. To begin filling this knowledge gap, a developmental iTRAQ analysis was performed revealing 647 proteins displaying differential abundance as the stigma matures in preparation for pollination. An in-depth comparison to an equivalent Brassicaceae analysis divulged both conservation and diversification in the makeup and function of proteins involved in the pollen and stigma encounter. SIGNIFICANCE: Successful pollination brings together the mature pollen and stigma thus initiating an intricate series of molecular processes vital to crop reproduction. In the Triticeae crops (e.g. wheat, barley, rye, triticale) there persists a vast deficit in our knowledge of the proteins involved which needs to be addressed if we are to face the many upcoming challenges to crop production such as those associated with climate change. At maturity, both the pollen and stigma have acquired the protein complement necessary for their forthcoming encounter and investigating their proteomes will inevitably provide unprecedented insights into the proteins enabling their interactions. By combining the analysis of the most comprehensive Triticeae pollen and stigma global proteome datasets to date with developmental iTRAQ investigations, proteins implicated in the different phases of pollen-stigma interaction enabling pollen adhesion, recognition, hydration, germination and tube growth, as well as those underlying stigma development were revealed. Extensive comparisons between equivalent Triticeae and Brassiceae datasets highlighted both the conservation of biological processes in line with the shared goal of activating the pollen grain and promoting pollen tube invasion of the pistil to effect fertilization, as well as the significant distinctions in their proteomes consistent with the considerable differences in their biochemistry, physiology and morphology.","03","2023","27","J Proteomics","Journal of proteomics","Brassica; Pollen; Proteomics; Stigma; Triticale; Triticeae; Proteome; Triticale; Pollen; Poaceae; Allergens; Pollination; Flowers; Pollen Tube","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:56:43.643282-04:00","No","","NaT"

Our study aimed at evaluating the effect of subsequent exposures to allergy-related anthropogenic and biogenic aerosols on cellular mechanism exposed at air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions. Bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells were exposed to UFP-rich combustion aerosols for 2&#xa0;h with or without allergen pre-exposure to birch pollen extract (BPE) or house dust mite extract (HDME).

We observed that single exposures with UFP, BPE, and HDME cause genotoxicity. Exposure to UFP induced pro-inflammatory canonical pathways, shifting to a more xenobiotic-related response with longer preincubation time. With additional allergen exposure, the modulation of pro-inflammatory and xenobiotic signaling was more pronounced and appeared faster. Moreover, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling activation showed to be an important feature of UFP toxicity, which was especially pronounced upon pre-exposure.

Genetic transformation of wheat is conducted using selectable markers, such as herbicide and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite their proven effectiveness, they do not provide visual control of the transformation process and transgene status in progeny, which creates uncertainty and prolongs screening procedures. To overcome this limitation, this study developed a fusion protein by combining gene sequences encoding phosphinothricin acetyltransferase and mCitrine fluorescent protein. The fusion gene, introduced into wheat cells by particle bombardment, enabled herbicide selection, and visual identification of primary transformants along with their progeny. This marker was then used to select transgenic plants containing a synthetic Ms2 gene. Ms2 is a dominant gene whose activation in wheat anthers leads to male sterility, but the relationship between the expression levels and the male-sterile phenotype is unknown. The Ms2 gene was driven either by a truncated Ms2 promoter containing a TRIM element or a rice promoter OsLTP6. The expression of these synthetic genes resulted in complete male sterility or partial fertility, respectively. The low-fertility phenotype was characterized by smaller anthers than the wild type, many defective pollen grains, and low seed sets. The reduction in the size of anthers was observed at earlier and later stages of their development. Consistently, Ms2 transcripts were detected in these organs, but their levels were significantly lower than those in completely sterile Ms2TRIM::Ms2 plants. These results suggested that the severity of the male-sterile phenotype was modulated by Ms2 expression levels and that higher levels may be key to activating total male sterility.","05","2023","08","Plant Cell Rep","Plant cell reports","Fusion protein; Male sterility; Ms2; Selectable marker; Wheat transformation; Yellow fluorescence; Male; Humans; Triticum; Phenotype; Fertility; Infertility, Male; Herbicides; Plants, Genetically Modified; Transformation, Genetic","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:47:14.425761-04:00","No","","NaT"

High temperatures interfered with pollen starch granule formation and ROS scavenging in oshsp60-3b anthers, leading to cell death and pollen abortion.

Such an approval went into effect in 2021 for TMX-coated sugar beet seeds in Germany. Usually, this crop is harvested before flowering without exposing non-target organisms to the active ingredient or its metabolites. In addition to the approval, strict mitigation measures were imposed by the EU and the German federal states. One of the measures was to monitor the drilling of sugar beet and its impact on the environment. Hence we took residue samples from different bee and plant matrices and at different dates to fully map beet growth in the German states of Lower Saxony, Bavaria, and Baden-W&#xfc;rttemberg. A total of four treated and three untreated plots were surveyed, resulting in 189 samples. Residue data were evaluated using the US Environmental Protection Agency BeeREX model to assess acute and chronic risk to honey bees from the samples, because oral toxicity data are widely available for both TMX and CLO. Within treated plots, we found no residues either in pools of nectar and honey crop samples (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;24) or dead bee samples (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21). Although 13% of beebread and pollen samples and 88% of weed and sugar beet shoot samples were positive, the BeeREX model found no evidence of acute or chronic risk.

Currently, there are insufficient data on wild bee species to allow for an individual risk assessment.

The genetic modifications do not give rise to safety concerns. The food enzyme is free from viable cells of the production organism and its DNA. It is intended to be used in five food manufacturing processes: fruit and vegetable processing for juice production, fruit and vegetable processing for products other than juice, production of wine and wine vinegar, production of plant extracts as flavouring preparations and coffee demucilation. Since residual amounts of total organic solids (TOS) are removed by repeated washing or distillation, dietary exposure to the food enzyme TOS from coffee demucilation and from the production of flavouring extracts was considered not necessary. For the remaining three food processes, dietary exposure was estimated to be up to 0.087&#xa0;mg TOS/kg body weight (bw) per day in European populations. Genotoxicity tests did not indicate a safety concern. The systemic toxicity was assessed by a repeated dose 90-day oral toxicity study in rats. The Panel identified a no observed adverse effect level of 1,000&#xa0;mg TOS/kg bw per day, the highest dose tested, which, when compared with the estimated dietary exposure, resulted in a margin of exposure of at least 11,494.

Ubiquitinated of S<sub>a</sub>-RNase might be determined by the interaction of FviBAG6-A in the ubiquitin-proteasome system during fertilization.

Analyses of paraffin sections and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content revealed that the majority of severe pollen defects were likely due to the early degradation of the tapetum and middle layer as a result of ROS accumulation and abnormal development of the uninucleate megaspore mother. Moreover, the FviBAG6-A interact with the E3 ligase SIZ1 and contribute to the SUMOylation of FviBAG6-A , which may be induced by the high level of ROS content, further promoting gametophyte abortion in strawberry transgenic lines.

We used plant and yeast genetics to characterize the role of two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) proteins possessing an EXS domain, namely ERD1A and ERD1B, in Golgi Pi homeostasis. ERD1A and ERD1B localized in cis-Golgi and were broadly expressed in vegetative and reproductive tissues. We identified ERD1 putative orthologs in algae, bryophytes, and vascular plants. Expressing ERD1A and ERD1B in yeast complemented the erd1 mutant phenotype of cellular Pi loss via exocytosis associated with reduced Golgi Pi export. The Arabidopsis erd1a mutant had a similar phenotype of apoplastic Pi loss dependent on exocytosis. ERD1A overexpression in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis led to partial mislocalization of ERD1A to the plasma membrane and specific Pi export to the apoplastic space. Arabidopsis erd1a had defects in cell wall biosynthesis, which were associated with reduced shoot development, hypocotyl growth, cell wall extensibility, root elongation, pollen germination, pollen tube elongation, and fertility.

While most eukaryotic genomes encode two APEs, plants usually possess three APEs, namely APE1L, APE2, and ARP. To date, the biological relevance and functional divergence of plant APEs are unclear. Here, we show that the three plant APEs have ancient origins, with the APE1L clade being plant-specific. In Arabidopsis thaliana, simultaneously mutating APE1L and APE2, but not ARP alone or in combination with either APE1L or APE2, results in clear developmental defects linked to genotoxic stress. Genetic analyses indicated that the three plant APEs have different substrate preferences in vivo. ARP is mainly responsible for AP site repair, while APE1L and APE2 prefer to repair 3' blocked single-stranded DNA breaks. We further determined that APEs play an important role in DNA repair and the maintenance of genomic integrity in meiotic cells. The ape1l ape2 double mutant exhibited a greatly enhanced frequency of SPO11-1-dependent and -independent double-strand DNA breaks. The DNA damage response was activated in ape1l ape2 to trigger pollen abortion.

However, the feature and evolutionary history of the GAUT gene family in Rosaceae species and candidates in pear pollen tube growth remain unclear.

This hypothesis is deduced because such pollinators can discriminate between intersexual flower size differences, and morphological differences between male and female flowers often diminish pollen transfer. We compared floral traits and pollinator behavior between male and female flowers in the hawkmoth-pollinated species, Trichosanthes cucumeroides. In field studies, we removed petal fringes on both sexes and observed pollinators to assess the role of elaborate petal fringes in pollinator attraction and pollination success for each flower sex. Female flowers had a similar front flower size and fringe extension as male flowers, supporting our hypothesis. In contrast, females allocated fewer resources to floral biomass. Additionally, they had smaller and narrower petal lobes, lower fringe density, shorter tubes with inferior nectar rewards, and lower display size than males, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis. Nocturnal hawkmoths prefer flowers with long fringe extensions. Fringe removal significantly decreased hawkmoth visitations to both female and male flowers but reduced success only in females. A literature survey indicated that female flowers of specialist-pollinated species are similar in size or larger than the males and thus tend to attract more pollinators compared with female flowers of generalist-pollinated species. Female flowers have evolved fringe extensions that are similar to those of male flowers, likely increasing pollinator attraction even slightly, and had less biomass in other floral parts and produced less nectar compared with male flowers. Our findings imply that female-biased resource limitation and flower-size sensitivity of pollinators together exert sex-specific selection of floral traits in T. cucumeroides.","04","2023","28","Am J Bot","American journal of botany","Cucurbitaceae; Japanese snake gourd; Trichosanthes cucumeroides; brief literature survey; dioecy; hawkmoth; petal fringe; sexual difference; specialist pollination","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:55:46.634791-04:00","No","","NaT"

We successfully managed to establish only the deformed wing virus (DWV) and the sacbrood virus (SBV), with different distribution frequencies depending on the territory of the country. The phylogenetic analyses of Bulgarian isolates were performed with the most similar sequences available in molecular databases from other countries. Phylogenies of Bulgarian viral strains demonstrated genetically heterogeneous populations of DWV and relatively homogenous populations of SBV.

These results reflect pyraclostrobin could decrease nutrient metabolism, immune competence and seriously affect the development of honeybees. It should be used cautiously in agricultural practices, especially in the process of bee pollination.","02","2023","28","Front Physiol","Frontiers in physiology","Apis mellifera; gene expression; larvae; pupae; pyraclostrobin","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:47:55.914091-04:00","No","","NaT"
"328","Chrysanthemum sporopollenin: A novel vaccine delivery system for nasal mucosal immunity.","36845130","10.3389/fimmu.2023.1132129","Mucosal immunization was an effective defender against pathogens. Nasal vaccines could activate both systemic and mucosal immunity to trigger protective immune responses. However, due to the weak immunogenicity of nasal vaccines and the lack of appropriate antigen carriers, very few nasal vaccines have been clinically approved for human use, which was a major barrier to the development of nasal vaccines. Plant-derived adjuvants are promising candidates for vaccine delivery systems due to their relatively safe immunogenic properties. In particular, the distinctive structure of pollen was beneficial to the stability and retention of antigen in the nasal mucosa. Herein, a novel wild-type chrysanthemum sporopollenin vaccine delivery system loaded with a w/o/w emulsion containing squalane and protein antigen was fabricated. The unique internal cavities and the rigid external walls within the sporopollenin skeleton construction could preserve and stabilize the inner proteins. The external morphological characteristics were suitable for nasal mucosal administration with high adhesion and retention. Secretory IgA antibodies in the nasal mucosa can be induced by the w/o/w emulsion with the chrysanthemum sporopollenin vaccine delivery system. Moreover, the nasal adjuvants produce a stronger humoral response (IgA and IgG) compared to squalene emulsion adjuvant. Mucosal adjuvant benefited primarily from prolongation of antigens in the nasal cavity, improvement of antigen penetration in the submucosa and promotion of CD8+ T cells in spleen. Based on effective delivering both the adjuvant and the antigen, the increase of protein antigen stability and the realization of mucosal retention, the chrysanthemum sporopollenin vaccine delivery system has the potential to be a promising adjuvant platform. This work provide a novel idea for the fabrication of protein-mucosal delivery vaccine.","02","2023","28","Front Immunol","Frontiers in immunology","adhesion; chrysanthemum; nasal mucosal immunity; sporopollenin; vaccine delivery system; Humans; Immunity, Mucosal; Emulsions; Vaccines; Nasal Mucosa; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Antigens","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:41:30.495743-04:00","No","","NaT"

Lily flowers have large anthers, which release a large amount of pollen that stains the tepals or clothing and thus can affect the commercial value of cut flowers. In this study, lily Oriental 'Siberia' was used to investigate the regulatory mechanism of lily anther development, which may provide information to prevent pollen pollution in the future. Based on the flower bud length, anther length and color, and anatomical observations, lily anther development was categorized into five stages: green (G), green-to-yellow 1 (GY1), green-to-yellow 2 (GY2), yellow (Y), and purple (P). Total RNA was extracted from the anthers at each stage for transcriptomic analysis. A total of 268.92-Gb clean reads were generated, and 81,287 unigenes were assembled and annotated. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and unique genes were largest for the pairwise comparison between the G and GY1 stages. The G and P samples were clustered separately, whereas the GY1, GY2, and Y samples were clustered together in scatter plots from a principal component analysis. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses of DEGs detected in the GY1, GY2, and Y stages revealed that the pectin catabolic process, hormone levels, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were enriched. The DEGs associated with jasmonic acid biosynthesis and signaling were highly expressed at the early stages (G and GY1), whereas the DEGs associated with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were mainly expressed in the intermediate stages (GY1, GY2, and Y). The DEGs involved in the pectin catabolic process were expressed at advanced stages (Y and P). Cucumber mosaic virus-induced gene silencing of <i>LoMYB21</i> and <i>LoAMS</i> caused a strongly inhibited anther dehiscence phenotype, but without affecting the development of other floral organs.

Hybrid rice from indica/xian and japonica/geng subspecies shows much higher heterosis and is thereby an important innovation in promoting rice production in the next decade. However, such inter-subspecific hybrid rice has long suffered from serious hybrid sterility, which is a major challenge that needs to be addressed. In this study, we performed a genome design strategy to produce fertile inter-subspecific hybrid by creation of wide compatibility varieties that are able to overcome hybrid sterility. Based on combined genetic analyses in two indica-japonica crosses, we determined that four hybrid sterility loci, S5, f5, pf12 and Sc, are the major QTLs controlling inter-subspecific hybrid sterility and thus the minimal targets that can be manipulated for breeding sub-specific hybrid rice. We then cloned the pf12 locus, one of the most effective loci for hybrid male sterility, by map-based cloning, and showed that artificial disruption of pf12A gene at this locus could successfully rescue hybrid fertility. We further dissected the genetic basis of wide compatibility using three pairwise crosses from a wide-compatibility variety Dular and representative indica and japonica varieties. On this basis, we constructed and assembled different combinations of naturally compatible alleles of four loci, S5, Sc, pf12, and f5, and found that the improved lines could fully recover pollen and embryo sac fertility in test-crossed F<sub>1</sub>s, thereby completely fulfilling the demands of inter-subspecific hybrid spikelet fertility in agricultural production. This breeding scheme would facilitate redesign of future inter-subspecific hybrid rice with a higher yield potential.","04","2023","06","Mol Plant","Molecular plant","Oryza; Plant Breeding; Quantitative Trait Loci; Fertility; Infertility","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:55:08.222746-04:00","No","","NaT"
"331","The Hybridization Barrier between Herbaceous <i>Medicago sativa</i> and Woody <i>M. arborea</i> Is Weakened by Reproductive Abnormalities in <i>M. sativa</i> Seed Parents.","36840310","10.3390/plants12040962","Historically, crosses between <i>Medicago sativa</i> (alfalfa) and <i>M. arborea</i> with alfalfa as the seed parent failed, as did crosses using <i>M. arborea</i> as the seed parent. Thus, a reproductive barrier kept the two species isolated until early in this century. The breakthrough came when alfalfa seed parents were identified in Wisconsin USA and Queensland AU that produced partial hybrids (hereafter hybrids). The hybrids were obtained by making large numbers of crosses on selected alfalfa parents. This was the first level of weakening the crossing barrier as reported in <i>Plants</i> in 2013. Further weakening of the barrier is reported herein whereby more hybrids were obtained with fewer crosses. This was accomplished by pedigree selection for new alfalfa seed parents and by using a product of the first hybrids called Alborea. New alfalfa seed parents were crossed with <i>M. arborea</i>, and Alborea parents were backcrossed to <i>M. arborea</i>. Hybrid plants were produced with fewer crosses in both cases. These hybrids, like the first hybrids, have mostly alfalfa traits but also have traits from <i>M. arborea</i>. It was theorized early on that the alfalfa component could be explained by 2n eggs in the alfalfa parents that were fertilized by normal n gametes from <i>M. arborea</i>. Evidence that the Wisconsin alfalfa and Alborea seed parents did in fact produce 2n eggs was reported in <i>Plants</i> in 2022. Moreover, they produced 2n eggs at approximately the same frequency that they produced hybrids. As reported herein, Alborea parents produced the highest frequency of hybrids and thus had the weakest barrier. Importantly, they also have the highest frequency of 2n eggs. It was determined that alfalfa and Alborea parents that produce 2n eggs and hybrids, also produce 2n pollen. In effect, an experiment was undertaken in reverse showing that 2n pollen could be used to screen for plants that produce hybrids. In the thousands of crosses made over the years, fertilization of normal n eggs in alfalfa parents always failed. Normal meiosis appears to be the main barrier to producing interspecific hybrids in our case. Fertilization of abnormal 2n eggs ensures sufficient alfalfa genetic material to continue embryogenesis. Evidently, the meiotic abnormality of 2n eggs is the major factor that weakens the crossing barrier.","02","2023","28","Plants (Basel)","Plants (Basel, Switzerland)","gametes; hybrid breakdown; interspecific hybrids; plant breeding; species; unreduced gametes","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:57:15.781069-04:00","No","","NaT"

To do this, we assessed crossability among <i>Cucumis</i> African wild species and <i>C. melo</i> at the pre-zygotic level by visualizing pollen tubes under fluorescence microscopy and, post-zygotically, by evaluating fruit/seed set and F<sub>1</sub> hybrid fertility. Genetic distances among <i>Cucumis</i> species were inferred from Genotyping-by-Sequencing, and its correlation with RI stages was analyzed. Observed pre- and post-zygotic IRBs included pollen tube arrest, fruit set failure, and hybrid male sterility.

Notably, the allotetraploid <i>C. ficifolius</i> was very fertile as a seed parent but infertile in all reciprocal crosses. Contribution to RI was found significant for both pre- and post-zygotic IRBs.

In order to obtain a comprehensive estimate of elements contributing to thrips resistance, flower tissues should be considered as well. Therefore, we assessed resistance to <i>Frankliniella occidentalis</i> in flowers, leaves, and whole plants of ten <i>Capsicum</i> accessions. Using choice assays, we found that thrips prefer flowers of certain accessions over others. The preference of adult thrips for flowers was positively correlated to trehalose and fructose concentration in anthers as well as to pollen quantity. Resistance measured on leaf discs and thrips population development on whole plants was significantly and positively correlated. Leaf-based resistance thus translates to reduced thrips population development. Results of the flower assays were not significantly correlated with resistance in leaves or on whole plants. This suggests that both leaves and flowers represent a different part of the resistance spectrum and should both be considered for understanding whole plant resistance and the identification of resistant <i>Capsicum</i> varieties.","02","2023","28","Plants (Basel)","Plants (Basel, Switzerland)","Frankliniella occidentalis; carbohydrates; crop breeding; insect resistance; nectar; pepper; pollen; population development","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:38:12.047209-04:00","No","","NaT"

In this research, the effect of ABA and BRs on rice growth characteristics and the development of spikelets under different salinity levels were investigated. The rice seedlings were subjected to three different salt stress levels: 0.0875 dS m<sup>-1</sup> (Control, CK), low salt stress (1.878 dS m<sup>-1</sup>, LS), and heavy salt stress (4.09 dS m<sup>-1</sup>, HS). Additionally, independent (ABA or BR) and combined (ABA+BR) exogenous treatments of ABA (at 0 and 25 &#x3bc;M concentration) and BR (at 0 and 5 &#x3bc;M concentration) onto the rice seedlings were performed. The results showed that the exogenous application of ABA, BRs, and ABA+BRs triggered changes in physiological and agronomic characteristics, including photosynthesis rate (Pn), SPAD value, pollen viability, 1000-grain weight (g), and rice grain yield per plant. In addition, spikelet sterility under different salt stress levels (CK, LS, and HS) was decreased significantly through the use of both the single phytohormone and the cocktail, as compared to the controls.

Model works on data coming from single particle detector (Rapid-E) that records for each particle optical fingerprint with scattered light and laser induced fluorescence. Morphological properties of a particle are sensed with the light scattering process, while chemical properties are encoded with fluorescence spectrum and fluorescence lifetime induced by high-resolution laser.

To estimate the potential effects of heterospecific pollen deposition (HPD) on female reproductive success, we counted conspecific (CP) and HP pollen grains deposited on stigmas and assessed subsequent seed set of both open- and hand-pollinated flowers in three co-flowering Silene species with exposed stigmas that usually received numerous HP grains on the elongated receptive area. HP percent per flower varied from 16.6% to 43.0% among three species. Silene chungtienensis experienced lower HP percent and the CP-HP relationship was neutral, S. gracilicaulis and S. yunnanensis experienced relatively higher HP percent and the CP-HP relationship was positive. Positive effects of CP and HP number on natural seed set were observed in all three species, but stronger negative effects of HP percent in S. chungtienensis and S. gracilicaulis. In hand-pollinated flowers of the three Silene species there was no decrease in seed set with HP whether CP was in excess or insufficient, indicating no negative effects of HPD on seed production. Consistent with the tolerance hypothesis, our results indicated that species experiencing higher HP interference are likely to be tolerant to an increase of HP percent.

PCR is a useful tool as an express method to evaluate editing results before pollination. A direct PCR protocol for pollen suspension has been adapted without needing DNA pre-extraction. We showed that the outer layer of lipids known as pollenkitt is a limiting factor for successful PCR on pollen. A simple pre-washing step of pollen suspension was able to eliminate the pollenkitt and enormously affect the PCR results. Additionally, our pollenkitt study helped us develop a simple and effective pollination method using wetted onion pollen grains. Classical manual pollination usually is conducted by intact pollen without wetting. Most existing methods of the editing system delivery into pollen are carried out in a wet medium with consequent drying before pollination, which adversely affects the viability of pollen. The optimal medium for wet pollination was 12% sucrose water solution.

In this multicentre, cross-sectional study, patients with AR were screened and administered questionnaires of demographic characteristics and health conditions (symptoms/diagnosis of AR and asthma, disease severity level, and allergic conditions). HRQoL was assessed using a modified version of the RHINASTHMA questionnaire (30, 'not at all bothered' - 150 'very much bothered') and symptom control was evaluated by a modified version of the Control of Allergic Rhinitis/Asthma Test (CARAT) (0, 'no control' - 30, 'very high control'). Out of 643 patients with AR, 500 (78%) had asthma as a comorbidity, and 54% had moderate-severe intermittent AR, followed by moderate-severe persistent AR (34%). Compared to the patients with AR alone, patients with AR&#xa0;+&#xa0;asthma had significantly higher RHINASTHMA (e.g., median RHINASTHMA-total score 48.5 vs. 84, respectively) and a significantly lower CARAT score (median CARAT-total score 23 vs. 16.5, respectively). Upon stratifying asthma based on severity, AR patients with severe persistent asthma had worse HRQoL and control than those with mild persistent asthma.

Young tapetal cells at prometaphase co-occurred with the pollen mother cells (PMCs) at diakinesis to metaphase, mature tapetal cells with disintegrated chromatin material co-occurred with tetrads and no tapetal cells were found at mature pollen stage. Cytological studies in young tapetal cells revealed most of these to be endopolyploid, with each having 40 chromosomes. While outnumbering somatic cells contained clear 40 chromosomes which seemed to be the outcome of endomitosis, a sizeable number of cells possessed 40 sticky chromosomes at metaphase. Later chromosomes are likely to form restitution nucleus. Mature tapetal cells, occurring singly/cytomictically connected (3.2-26.31%) or showing coalescence (10.5-22.8%), did not contain recognizable chromosomes.

Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and Restorer gene (<i>Rf</i>) systems are essential components for heterosis-based breeding. However, the molecular mechanism underlying CMS remains largely unclear in soybean. We integrated a morphological investigation with comparative analyses of transcriptomic and proteomic changes in pollen from the CMS line W931A and its maintainer line, W931B, at the uninucleate microspore (UM) and binucleate pollen (BP) stages. Compared to W931B, which had healthy, oval pollen grains, W931A showed shrunken or degraded pollen grains with an irregularly thickened endothelium and decreased starch accumulation. Transcriptomic comparisons revealed a total of 865 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in W931A over the two stages. These genes were primarily associated with pentose and glucuronate interconversions, sphingolipid metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism. Proteomic analysis revealed 343 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), which were mainly involved in carbon metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and nitrogen metabolism. Consistently, Gene Ontology (GO) biological process terms related to pollen development were enriched among DEGs at the UM and BP stages. Notably, four genes with demonstrated roles in pollen development were differentially expressed, including AGAMOUS-LIKE 104, PROTEIN-TYROSINE-PHOSPHATASE 1, and PHOSPHOLIPASE A2. A total of 53 genes and the corresponding proteins were differentially expressed in W931A at both the UM and BP stages, and many of these were pectinesterases, polygalacturonases, peroxidases, and ATPases. The results of this study suggest that pollen development in W931A is likely regulated through suppression of the identified DEGs and DEPs.

By artificially manipulating the flower to present gynophore straightened in the floral center or bend to one side, we attempted to investigate whether herkogamy movement affects pollinator access efficiency, pollen removal and deposition, and seed set ratio. Furthermore, we conducted artificial pollination in the female phase to evaluate the effect of changes in pollination environment on the variations in herkogamy traits. The results showed that gynophore straightened in female phase favors pollen deposition, whereas gynophore bending in male phase was conducive to the removal of pollen. Visitation frequency, pollen deposition and removal, and seed set ratio decreased significantly when the gynophore movement was manipulated. Finally, the bending of gynophore was obviously promoted by pollination. Therefore, the continuous variation of herkogamy in the same flower of <i>E.&#xa0;fischeriana</i> caused by the bending of the gynophore could improve the accuracy of pollination and avoid the interference of the ovary with access efficiency.

Barley is a widely grown cereal crop used for stock feed, malting and brewing. Abiotic stresses, particularly global warming, are the major causes of crop yield losses by affecting fertility and seed set. However, effects of heat stress on reproductive structures and fertility in barley have not been extensively investigated. In this study we examined three commercial European spring barley varieties under high temperature conditions to investigate the effects on floret development. Using a combination of fertility assays, X-ray micro computed tomography, 3-dimensional modelling, cytology and immunolabelling, we observed that male reproductive organs are severely impacted by increased temperature, while the female reproductive organs are less susceptible. Importantly, the timing of stress relative to reproductive development had a significant impact on fertility in a cultivar-dependent manner, this was most significant at pollen mitosis stage with fertility ranged from 31.6-56.0% depending on cultivar. This work provides insight into how heat stress, when applied during male pollen mother cell meiosis and pollen mitosis, affects barley fertility and seed set, and also describes complementary invasive and non-invasive techniques to investigate floret development.

Inspired by the carbonization process of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a novel species of carbon dots derived from Pollen Typhae (PT-CDs) was separated and then collected using a one-pot pyrolysis method. The as-prepared PT-CDs (4.85&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.06&#xa0;nm) with negative charge and abundant oxygenated groups exhibited high solubility, and they were stable in water. Moreover, the rhabdomyolysis (RM)-induced AKI rat model was used, and it was first demonstrated that PT-CDs had significant activity in improving the level of BUN and CRE, urine volume and kidney index, and histopathological morphology in RM-induced AKI rats. It is noteworthy that interventions of PT-CDs significantly reduced degree of inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress, which may be correlated with the basial potential mechanism of anti-AKI activities. Furthermore, cytotoxicity assay and biosafety evaluation exhibited high biocompatibility of PT-CDs. This study offers a novel relieving strategy for AKI based on PT-CDs and suggests its potential to be a related candidate for clinical applications.","02","2023","24","J Nanobiotechnology","Journal of nanobiotechnology","Acute kidney injury; Biomass; Carbon dots; Pollen Typhae; Rhabdomyolysis; Rats; Animals; Carbon; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Acute Kidney Injury; Kidney; Rhabdomyolysis","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:50:56.672574-04:00","No","","NaT"

Stomata are key cellular structures for gas and water exchange in plants and their development is influenced by several genes. We found the A. thaliana bagel23-D (bgl23-D) mutant showing abnormal bagel-shaped single guard cells. The bgl23-D was a novel dominant mutation in the A. thaliana cellulose synthase-like D5 (ATCSLD5) gene that was reported to function in the division of guard mother cells. The dominant character of bgl23-D was used to inhibit ATCSLD5 function in specific cells and tissues. Transgenic A. thaliana expressing bgl23-D cDNA with the promoter of stomata lineage genes, SDD1, MUTE, and FAMA, showed bagel-shaped stomata as observed in the bgl23-D mutant. Especially, the FAMA promoter exhibited a higher frequency of bagel-shaped stomata with severe cytokinesis defects. Expression of bgl23-D cDNA in the tapetum with SP11 promoter or in the anther with ATSP146 promoter induced defects in exine pattern and pollen shape, novel phenotypes that were not shown in the bgl23-D mutant. These results indicated that bgl23-D inhibited unknown ATCSLD(s) that exert the function of exine formation in the tapetum. Furthermore, transgenic A. thaliana expressing bgl23-D cDNA with SDD1, MUTE, and FAMA promoters showed enhanced rosette diameter and increased leaf growth.

"364","Poly(A) polymerase 1 contributes to competence acquisition of pollen tubes growing through the style in Arabidopsis thaliana.","36811355","10.1111/tpj.16162","Polyadenylation of mRNAs is critical for their export from the nucleus, stability, and efficient translation. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes three isoforms of canonical nuclear poly(A) polymerase (PAPS) that redundantly polyadenylate the bulk of pre-mRNAs. However, previous studies have indicated that subsets of pre-mRNAs are preferentially polyadenylated by either PAPS1 or the other two isoforms. Such functional specialization raises the possibility of an additional level of gene-expression control in plants. Here we test this notion by studying the function of PAPS1 in pollen-tube growth and guidance. Pollen tubes growing through female tissue acquire the competence to find ovules efficiently and upregulate PAPS1 expression at the transcriptional, but not detectably at the protein level compared with in vitro grown pollen tubes. Using the temperature-sensitive paps1-1 allele we show that PAPS1 activity during pollen-tube growth is required for full acquisition of competence, resulting in inefficient fertilization by paps1-1 mutant pollen tubes. While these mutant pollen tubes grow almost at the wild-type rate, they are compromised in locating the micropyles of ovules. Previously identified competence-associated genes are less expressed in paps1-1 mutant than in wild-type pollen tubes. Estimating the poly(A) tail lengths of transcripts suggests that polyadenylation by PAPS1 is associated with reduced transcript abundance. Our results therefore suggest that PAPS1 plays a key role in the acquisition of competence and underline the importance of functional specialization between PAPS isoforms throughout different developmental stages.","05","2023","01","Plant J","The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology","Arabidopsis thaliana; competence; pollen tubes; pollen-pistil interaction; poly(A) polymerase; Arabidopsis; Pollen Tube; Arabidopsis Proteins; Polynucleotide Adenylyltransferase; Protein Isoforms; Mutation","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:42:04.152246-04:00","No","","NaT"

We study 36145 symptom reports submitted over 5 years by over 700 UK residents using a mobile application. Scores were recorded for nose, eyes and breathing. Symptom reports are labelled as urban or rural using land-use data from the UK's Office for National Statistics. Reports are compared with AURN network pollution measurements and pollen and meteorological data taken from the UK Met Office. Our analysis suggests urban areas record significantly higher symptom severity for all years except 2017. Rural areas do not record significantly higher symptom severity in any year. Additionally, symptom severity correlates with more air quality markers in urban areas than rural areas, indicating that differences in allergy symptoms may be due to variations in the levels of pollutants, pollen counts and seasonality across land-use types. The results suggest that a relationship exists between urban surroundings and hay fever symptoms.","02","2023","24","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","Humans; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Pollen; Air Pollution; Nose; United Kingdom","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:40:26.727893-04:00","No","","NaT"

We provide genetic evidence of hybridisation contributing to the expansion of the rare Eucalyptus risdonii into the range of the widespread Eucalyptus amygdalina. These closely related tree species are morphologically distinct, and observations suggest that natural hybrids occur along their distribution boundaries and as isolated trees or in small patches within the range of E.&#xa0;amygdalina. Hybrid phenotypes occur outside the range of normal dispersal for E.&#xa0;risdonii seed, yet in some hybrid patches small individuals resembling E.&#xa0;risdonii occur and are hypothesised to be a result of backcrossing. Using 3362 genome-wide SNPs assessed from 97 individuals of E.&#xa0;risdonii and E.&#xa0;amygdalina and 171 hybrid trees, we show that (i) isolated hybrids match the genotypes expected of F<sub>1</sub> /F<sub>2</sub> hybrids, (ii) there is a continuum in the genetic composition among the isolated hybrid patches from patches dominated by F<sub>1</sub> /F<sub>2</sub> -like genotypes to those dominated by E.&#xa0;risdonii-backcross genotypes, and (iii) the E.&#xa0;risdonii-like phenotypes in the isolated hybrid patches are most-closely related to proximal larger hybrids. These results suggest that the E.&#xa0;risdonii phenotype has been resurrected in isolated hybrid patches established from pollen dispersal, providing the first steps in its invasion of suitable habitat by long-distance pollen dispersal and complete introgressive displacement of E.&#xa0;amygdalina.

Increased heat tolerance of <i>hst1</i> was associated with suppressed expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging peroxidases and increased ROS levels, which reduced water loss by decreasing stomatal aperture under heat stress. In addition, increased ROS levels enhanced expression of genes encoding heat shock protein (HSPs) including HSP80, HSP74, HSP58 and small HSPs. HSPs promote stabilization of proteins and protein refolding under heat stress and accordingly mutation of <i>HST1</i> also improved reproductive traits including pollen viability and seed setting under high temperature.

FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINs (FLAs), which impact plant growth and development, are an excellent example of a glycoprotein family with a complex multidomain structure. FLAs combine globular fasciclin-like (FAS1) domains with regions that are intrinsically disordered and contain glycomotifs for directing the addition of O-linked arabinogalactan (AG) glycans. Additional posttranslational modifications on FLAs include N-linked glycans in the FAS1 domains, a cleaved signal peptide at the N terminus, and often a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor signal sequence at the C terminus. The roles of glycosylation, the GPI anchor, and FAS1 domain functions in the polysaccharide-rich extracellular matrix of plants remain unclear, as do the relationships between them. In this study, we examined sequence-structure-function relationships of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FLA11, demonstrated to have roles in secondary cell wall (SCW) development, by introducing domain mutations and functional specialization through domain swaps with FLA3 and FLA12. We identified FAS1 domains as essential for FLA function, differentiating FLA11/FLA12, with roles in SCW development, from FLA3, specific to flowers and involved in pollen development. The GPI anchor and AG glycosylation co-regulate the cell surface location and release of FLAs into cell walls. The AG glycomotif sequence closest to the GPI anchor (AG2) is a major feature differentiating FLA11 from FLA12. The results of our study show that the multidomain structure of different FLAs influences their subcellular location and biological functions during plant development.","05","2023","04","Plant Physiol","Plant physiology","Plant Proteins; Mucoproteins; Arabidopsis; Glycoproteins; Polysaccharides","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 19:06:59.969147-04:00","No","","NaT"

The present study intended to investigate the influences of Pollen typhae extract named Pollen typhae total flavone (PTF) on A7r5 cell proliferation promoted by insulin and to uncover the underlying mechanisms. Proliferation and viability were evaluated by CCK-8 method. Western blotting was adopted to analyze the protein expression. Insulin promoted A7r5 cell proliferation, while PTF suppressed insulin-promoted proliferation in a concentration-dependent fashion. Although PTF did not change c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) or MAPK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) protein expression and failed to affect the phosphorylation of JNK and p38MAPK, PTF remarkably inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) protein expression and reduced ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 phosphorylation in A7r5 cells stimulated by insulin. Insulin-induced proliferation of A7r5 cells was abolished by inhibiting ERK1/2, which was in line with PTF.

Here, we report that a transcription factor, DEFECTIVE IN TAPETAL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION 1 (TDF1), inhibits tapetal cell division leading to cell differentiation. We identified SKEWED5-SIMILAR 18 (SKS18) as a downstream target of TDF1. Enzymatic assays showed that SKS18, annotated as a multicopper oxidase-like protein, has ascorbate oxidase activity, leading to AsA oxidation. We also show that VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE1 (VTC1), an AsA biosynthetic enzyme, is negatively controlled by TDF1 to maintain proper AsA contents. Consistently, either knockout of SKS18 or VTC1 overexpression raised AsA concentrations, resulting in extra tapetal cells, while SKS18 overexpression in tdf1 or the vtc1-3 tdf1 double mutant mitigated their defective tapetum. We observed that high AsA concentrations caused lower accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tapetal cells. Overexpression of ROS scavenging genes in tapetum restored excess cell divisions.

This review discusses the sources of major indoor air pollutants, molecular toxicity mechanisms, and their effects on cardiovascular, ocular, neurological, women, and foetal health. Additionally, contemporary strategies and sustainable methods for regulating and reducing pollutant concentrations are emphasized, and current initiatives to address and enhance IAQ are explored, along with their unique advantages and potentials. Due to their longer exposure times and particular physical characteristics, women and children are more at risk for poor indoor air quality. By triggering many toxicity mechanisms, including oxidative stress, DNA methylation, epigenetic modifications, and gene activation, indoor air pollution can cause a range of health issues. Low birth weight, acute lower respiratory tract infections, Sick building syndromes (SBS), and early death are more prevalent in exposed residents.

However, there were no significant differences in anthers, stigmas and pollen viability between the transgenic lines and WT.

We introduced a modeling approach to assess the ecological risks of neonicotinoids using honeybee and earthworm as model organisms, and the simulation was flexible under different environmental conditions. Using the cotton plant as an example, the simulation results demonstrated that under current recommended application rates, the use of common neonicotinoid insecticides posed no threat to earthworms, with the simulated risk quotients (RQs) much lower than 1. However, the simulation for some neonicotinoid insecticides (e.g., acetamiprid) indicated that using these insecticides on cotton plants could threaten honeybees, with simulated RQs higher than 1. The variability analysis showed that in high-latitude regions, the unacceptable risk to honeybees posed by insecticide application can be further elevated due to cold, wet weather that results in relatively high insecticide levels in pollen and nectar. The model evaluation showed large overlaps of simulated risk intervals between the proposed and existing (BeeREX) models. Because the proposed and existing models have different simulation mechanisms, we recommend that these two models be used together to complement each other in future studies.

Conservation concerns prompted an in-depth systematic study of this taxon and its putative relatives. Sampling most known populations of D. maguirei s.l. (D. maguirei var. maguirei and D. maguirei var. burkei), we integrate data from geography, ecology, morphology, cytogenetics and pollen, enzyme electrophoresis, and the phylogenetic analysis of nuclear internal transcribed spacer sequences to explore potential taxonomic diversity in the species complex. Draba maguirei var. burkei is shown here to be a distinct species (D. burkei) most closely related to D. globosa, rather than to D. maguirei. Within D. maguirei s.s., the northern (high elevation) and southern (low elevation) population clusters are genetically isolated and morphologically distinguishable, leading to the recognition here of the southern taxon as D. maguirei subsp. stonei. Our study reveals that plants traditionally assigned to D. maguirei comprise three genetically divergent lineages (D. burkei and two newly recognized subspecies of D. maguirei), each exhibiting a different chromosome number and occupying a discrete portion of the geographic range. Although previously overlooked and underappreciated taxonomically, the three taxa are morphologically recognizable based on the distribution and types of trichomes present on the leaves, stems, and fruit.

AGPs have long been suggested to play important roles in sexual plant reproduction. The synthesis of their complex carbohydrates is initiated by a family of hydroxyproline galactosyltransferase (Hyp-GALT) enzymes which add the first galactose to Hyp residues in the protein backbone. Eight Hyp-GALT enzymes have been identified so far, and in the present work a mutant affecting five of these enzymes (galt2galt5galt7galt8galt9) was analyzed regarding the reproductive process. The galt25789 mutant presented a low seed set, and reciprocal crosses indicated a significant female gametophytic contribution to this mutant phenotype. Mutant ovules revealed abnormal callose accumulation inside the embryo sac and integument defects at the micropylar region culminating in defects in pollen tube reception. In addition, immunolocalization and biochemical analyses allowed the detection of a reduction in the amount of glucuronic acid in mutant ovary AGPs. Dramatically low amounts of high-molecular-weight Hyp-O-glycosides obtained following size exclusion chromatography of base-hydrolyzed mutant AGPs compared to the wild type indicated the presence of underglycosylated AGPs in the galt25789 mutant, while the monosaccharide composition of these Hyp-O-glycosides displayed no significant changes compared to the wild-type Hyp-O-glycosides.

Blowflies are an ideal candidate for such research because they are widespread, abundant, and can be easily collected within rainforests. We genotyped 188 blowflies (Chrysomya latifrons) from 15 isolated rainforests and found high levels of gene flow, a lack of genetic structure between rainforests, and low genetic diversity - suggesting the presence of a single large genetically depauperate population.

At Site 1 in Summerland Research and Development Centre (""""SuRDC1""""), where a 'Lapins' on Krymsk 5 planting was located in a frost pocket where the crops were exposed to high risk of cold damage in the spring, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the floral organ viability and percent fruit set under low temperatures, and under the effects of four spring horticultural mitigation measures. Installation of polyethylene sleeves and FAME spray (fatty acid methyl esters-based plant growth regulator, WAIKEN, SST Australia) were implemented in 2019; boric acid spray and postponed irrigation were tested in 2022. Low fruit set at SuRDC1 in both years was associated with severe pistil browning after night temperature dropped below -4 &#xb0;C in late April. In 2019, the semi-enclosure of polyethylene sleeves led to an increase in the surface temperature (T<sub>surfae</sub>) of floral buds by 2-4 &#xb0;C, which prolonged the stage of first bloom, delayed petal fall and prevented frost damage on pistils, but led to the decrease in percent fruit set by 77%, due to ovule abortion or cessation of fruitlet development. The early and late sprays of FAME had no significant influence on either abundance of germinated pollen tubes or percent fruit set; however, the potential of late spray in improving pollen abundance and reducing pistil browning requires further investigation. In 2022, the spray of 0.01% boric acid solution led to a decrease in fruit set by 6.95%. Six-week postponement of irrigation starting from full bloom decreased soil moisture, but increased soil temperature and improved fruit set by 7.61%. The results improved our understanding about the damages of adverse spring air temperatures on pistils and ovules, and suggested the potential of irrigation adjustment in regulating soil moisture and temperature and improving fruit set in the cool and moist spring.""","02","2023","13","Plants (Basel)","Plants (Basel, Switzerland)","anthesis; cold injury; fruit set; ovule abortion; pistil browning; pollen germination; soil temperature; warming","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:40:45.266944-04:00","No","","NaT"

The survey was conducted using the CAWI (Computer-Assisted Web Interview) method on 487 respondents. It was found that honey is used mainly for culinary purposes and, to a lesser extent, for medicinal and cosmetic purposes. Other bee products are much less commonly used than honey-mainly beeswax and royal jelly for cosmetic purposes and propolis and bee pollen for medicinal purposes. Segments distinguished by the frequency of use of honey for particular purposes were differentiated by gender, age, income level, use of other bee products, and motivation to use them. Their differences were also found in terms of the level of nutritional knowledge and self-assessed health status-the highest ratings in both categories were indicated by representatives of the Honey users' segment, which consisted of people who use honey most frequently for cooking, cosmetic and medicinal purposes. Regression analysis additionally showed that higher levels of nutritional knowledge and better health status were associated with the use of honey to treat gastrointestinal ailments and with the use of propolis for medicinal purposes.","02","2023","14","Nutrients","Nutrients","Poland; bee products; consumers behaviour; health self-assessment; nutritional knowledge; Honey; Propolis; Poland; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:55:39.418441-04:00","No","","NaT"

As RVs and allergens may act synergistically to promote airway inflammation, simultaneous treatment strategies for both causative agents would be innovative. We have previously identified the transmembrane glycoprotein intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) as an anchor for antibody conjugates bispecific for ICAM-1 and <i>Phleum pratense</i> (Phl p) 2, a major grass pollen allergen, to block allergen transmigration through the epithelial barrier. Since ICAM-1 is a receptor for the major group RVs, we speculated that our bispecific antibody conjugates may protect against RV infection. Therefore, we created antibody conjugates bispecific for ICAM-1 and the major grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 and analyzed their capacity to affect allergen penetration and RV infection. Bispecific antibody conjugates significantly reduced the trans-epithelial migration of Phl p 5 and thus the basolateral Phl p 5 concentration and allergenic activity as determined by humanized rat basophilic leukemia cells and inhibited RV infection of cultured epithelial cells. A reduction in allergenic activity was obtained only through the prevention of allergen transmigration because the Phl p 5-specific IgG antibody did not block the allergen-IgE interaction. Our results indicate the potential of allergen/ICAM-1-specific antibody conjugates as a topical treatment strategy for allergy and RV infections.","02","2023","14","Int J Mol Sci","International journal of molecular sciences","ICAM-1; allergen; allergy; antibody; respiratory epithelium; rhinovirus; topical treatment; Allergens; Rhinovirus; Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1; Immunoglobulin E; Pollen; Hypersensitivity; Poaceae; Phleum; Plant Proteins","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:39:36.594452-04:00","No","","NaT"

Sixteen peer-reviewed publications were included in the data set. The rabbit strains used in the studies included in the data set were New Zealand White, V-line, Rex, and V-line crosses. Weighted mean differences (WMD) between treatments supplemented with BP or PRO and control treatments were used to assess the magnitude of the effect. BP supplementation decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) daily feed intake (DFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR); however, increased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) average daily gain (ADG) and hot carcass yield (HCY). PRO supplementation reduced DFI (<i>p</i> = 0.041) and FCR (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and increased ADG (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and HCY (<i>p</i> = 0.005). In blood serum, BP supplementation increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC; <i>p</i> = 0.002) and decreased serum creatinine concentration (<i>p</i> = 0.049). Likewise, decreased serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected in response to BP supplementation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). PRO supplementation increased the TAC in blood serum (<i>p</i> = 0.018); however, decreased serum concentrations of AST, ALT, and MDA were observed (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).

"401","Effects of Bee Pollen Derived from <i>Acer mono</i> Maxim. or <i>Phellodendron amurense</i> Rupr. on the Lipid Composition of Royal Jelly Secreted by Honeybees.","36766159","10.3390/foods12030625","Royal jelly is a specific product secreted by honeybees, and has been sought after to maintain health because of its valuable bioactive substances, e.g., lipids and vitamins. The lipids in royal jelly come from the bee pollen consumed by honeybees, and different plant source of bee pollen affects the lipid composition of royal jelly. However, the effect of bee pollen consumption on the lipid composition of royal jelly remains unclear. Herein, we examined the influence of two factors on the lipid composition of royal jelly: first, two plant sources of bee pollen, i.e., <i>Acer mono</i> Maxim. (BP-Am) and <i>Phellodendron amurense</i> Rupr. (BP-Pa); secondly, different feeding times. Lipidomic analyses were conducted on the royal jelly produced by honeybees fed BP-Am or BP-Pa using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The results showed that the phospholipid and fatty acid contents differed in royal jelly produced by honeybees fed BP-Am compared to those fed BP-Pa. There were also differences between timepoints, with many lipid compounds decreasing in abundance soon after single-pollen feeding began, slowly increasing over time, then decreasing again after 30 days of single-pollen feeding. The single bee pollen diet destroyed the nutritional balance of bee colonies and affected the development of hypopharyngeal and maxillary glands, resulting in differences in royal jelly quality. This study provides guidance for optimal selection of honeybee feed for the production of high-quality royal jelly.","02","2023","13","Foods","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)","UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry; bee pollen; lipidomics; royal jelly","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:18:02.269206-04:00","No","","NaT"

The pollinium of Hoya has an outer sporopollenin wall and a pellucid margin which are adaptive features. However, their ontogeny and related evolutionary implications are not entirely understood. Therefore, a representative species Hoya carnosa was selected to investigate the pollinium development using light and electron microscopy and cytochemical tests. In contrast to the microsporogenesis in most angiosperms, which is associated with callose, the non-callosic intersporal walls in Hoya carnosa, together with the successive cytokinesis and linear form of the tetrad, represent an alternative pattern of microsporogenesis. This pattern has specific implication for the early stages of pollen morphogenesis. The absence of exine and apertures in the pollen grains in the pollinium could result from a combination of factors including the absence of callose in the early stages and the modifications in later developmental pathways, e.g., the sporopollenin accumulation pathway. The pollinium wall is an exine without stratification, its surface lacks sculptures, and it provides structural support and protection. The pollen tubes germinate through the pellucid margin and germinating ridge which are specialized features. The pellucid margin originates from aborted microspores. The germinating ridge that lies on the outer side of the pellucid margin develops in the same way as a classic pollen exine. The pollen grains are aggregated by intine fusion which is favorable for tube germination and growth. Comparing Asclepiadoideae with the other two subfamilies of Apocynaceae that develop a pollinium, the pollinium of Asclepiadoideae has reduced deposition of sporopollenin in the inner walls but an increase in the outer pollinium wall, thus making the inner walls more reduced and simplified, and the outer walls more solid. The adaptive characters of the pollen wall structure and the cohesion mechanism suggest that the pollinium of Hoya carnosa is a derived form of pollen aggregation.","02","2023","10","Plant Reprod","Plant reproduction","Callose absence; Germinating ridge; Microspore abortion; Pellucid margin; Pollen development; Structural adaptations","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:43:27.549018-04:00","No","","NaT"

Late acting self-incompatibility (LSI) in <i>C. oleifera</i> results in a relatively poor fruit yield in the natural state, and understanding of the LSI mechanism remains limited. To better understand the molecular expression and gene coexpression network in the LSI reaction in <i>C. oleifera</i>, we conducted self- and cross-pollination experiments at two different flower bud developmental stages (3-4 d before flowering and 1 d before flowering), and cytological observation, fruit setting rate (FSR) investigation and RNA-Seq analysis were performed to investigate the mechanism of the male -female interaction and identify hub genes responsible for the LSI in <i>C. oleifera</i>. Based on the 21 ovary transcriptomes, a total of 7669 DEGs were identified after filtering out low-expression genes. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) divided the DEGs into 15 modules. Genes in the blue module (1163 genes) were positively correlated with FSR, and genes in the pink module (339 genes) were negatively correlated with FSR. KEGG analysis indicated that flavonoid biosynthesis, plant MAPK signaling pathways, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and plant-pathogen interaction were the crucial pathways for the LSI reaction. Fifty four transcription factors (TFs) were obtained in the two key modules, and WRKY and MYB were potentially involved in the LSI reaction in <i>C. oleifera</i>. Network establishment indicated that genes encoding G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine (lecRLK), isoflavone 3'-hydroxylase-like (CYP81Q32), cytochrome P450 87A3-like (CYP87A3), and probable calcium-binding protein (CML41) were the hub genes that positively responded to the LSI reaction. The other DEGs inside the two modules, including protein RALF-like 10 (RALF), F-box and pectin acetylesterase (MTERF5), might also play vital roles in the LSI reaction in <i>C. oleifera</i>. Overall, our study provides a meaningful resource for gene network studies of the LSI reaction process and subsequent analyses of pollen-pistil interactions and TF roles in the LSI reaction, and it also provides new insights for exploring the mechanisms of the LSI response.","02","2023","11","Front Plant Sci","Frontiers in plant science","camellia oleifera; hub genes; late-acting self-incompatibility; pollination; transcriptome","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:52:12.101087-04:00","No","","NaT"

The feeding of those insects depends on the spatial and temporal distribution of nectar and pollen as food resource. Hence, to protect insect biodiversity, a spatio-temporal assessment of food quantity of their habitats is necessary. Therefore, sufficient data on traits of floral resources are required. As floral resources' traits of plants are important to quantify food availability, we present two databases, the FloRes Database (Floral Resources Database) and the raw database, from where FloRes was derived. Both databases contain the plant traits: (1) flowering period, (2) floral-unit density per day, (3) nectar volume per floral unit per day, (4) sugar content per floral unit, (5) sugar concentration in nectar, (6) pollen mass or volume per floral unit and per day, (7) protein content of pollen and (8) corolla depth. All traits were sampled from literature and online databases. The raw database consists of 702 specified plant species, 138 unspecified species 37 species (spec., sp), 22 species <i>pluralis</i> (spp) and, for 79, only the genus was identified) and two species complexes (agg.). Those 842 taxa belong to 488 genera and 102 families. Finally, only 27 taxa have a complete set of traits, too few for a sufficient assessment of spatio-temporal availability of floral food-resources.As information on floral resources is scattered throughout many publications with different units, we also present our multistep workflow implemented in five consecutive R-scripts. The multistep workflow standardises the trait units of the raw database to comparable entities with identical units and aggregates them on a reasonable taxonomic level into the second application database, the FloRes Database. Finally, the FloRes Database contains aggregated information of traits for 42 taxa and, when corolla depth is excluded, for 72 taxa.This is the first attempt to gather these eight traits from different literature sources into one database with a multistep workflow. The publication of the multistep workflow enables the users to extend the FloRes Database on their own demands with other literature data or newly-gathered data to improve quantification of food resources. Especially, the combination of pollen, nectar and the open flowers per square metre is, as far as we know, a novelty.The FloRes Database can be used to evaluate the quantity of food-resource habitats available for pollinators, for example, to compare seed mixtures of agri-environmental measures, such as flower strips, considering flower phenology on a daily basis.","02","2023","11","Biodivers Data J","Biodiversity data journal","bumblebees; corolla; floral resource; habitat assessment; hoverflies; nectar; phenology; pollen; pollinators; protein; sugar concentration","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:21:07.105929-04:00","No","","NaT"

SQ&#xae; Tree SLIT-Tablet (ITULAZAX&#xae;) is a sublingual immunotherapy tablet indicated for moderate-to-severe AR and/or conjunctivitis induced by pollen from the birch homologous group. The present analysis evaluated the cost-utility of treating adults with AR with SQ Tree SLIT-Tablet versus placebo, both in combination with symptom-relieving medications, from a Swedish societal perspective. A model was developed to evaluate changes in cost and quality of life associated with using SQ Tree SLIT-Tablet relative to placebo in an adult population of individuals with AR. The model captured costs associated with symptom-relieving medications, healthcare professional interactions, SQ Tree SLIT-Tablet, and indirect costs arising from absenteeism and reduced workplace productivity. The analysis was conducted over 10 years with costs captured in 2021 Swedish Krona (SEK) and future costs and effects discounted at 3% per annum. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Treatment with SQ Tree SLIT-Tablet resulted in an improvement of 0.041 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 10 years versus placebo. From a Swedish societal perspective, costs increased by SEK 9077 over the same period, resulting in an incremental cost-utility ratio of SEK 223,445 per QALY gained.

Although the role of the stigmas in pollination is the same for all angiosperms, stigmas structures are very diverse. This study aimed to evaluate intraspecific, interspecific and intergeneric stigmas variability and then find differences of the stigma morphology amongst 24 holoparasitic <i>Orobanche</i> and <i>Phelipanche</i> species and provide new insights into its potential taxonomic value. This paper was also focused on selecting the best diagnostic features that would be used for future stigma analysis in other species of Orobanchaceae. These analyses were conducted with fresh, dry and fixed material using stereomicroscopy from different locations from Central Europe. Twenty-one quantitative or qualitative morphological features were analysed. This study highlights the variation of stigma morphology and characters which are useful to improve the taxonomic understanding of problematic taxa. Thus, two main types of stigmas were established, based on tested features: 1-oval, rarely hemispherical in shape, most often one-coloured with lobes separated in <i>Phelipanche</i> stigmas; 2-spherical to hemispherical, rarely oval, multi-coloured with partially fused or separated lobes in <i>Orobanche</i> stigmas. The best diagnostic features of the stigmas for distinguishing the Orobanchaceae are the type and subtype of stigma, the length and area of the stigma, the width of single lobes, the width in the middle part of the stigma, the length of upper and lower separation in the middle part between lobes and the angle between lobes in the upper and lower part. The morphological features of the stigmas are important criteria for distinguishing genera, sections and subsections, as well as related species.

Recent studies have indicated that the effect of heterospecific pollen (HP) on reproduction success is variable and depends on the identity of donor and recipient species. However, few studies have documented variation in HP receipt and evaluated the reproductive effects of HP receipt across geographic locations under natural conditions. We investigated the spatial variation of pollen deposition across eight sites and how the pollen receipt related to the seed set of <i>Salvia przewalskii</i>, a subalpine perennial herb in Hengduan Mountain in southwest China. We found that stigmatic pollen loads substantially varied among sites for several metrics, including quantities of conspecific and heterospecific pollen, the proportion of HP, and species composition of HP donors. Five different plant families were the most common HP source at one or two sites, and the proportion of HP ranged from 3.4% to 51.3% across sites. The association of conspecific pollen with seed set was positive and variable among sites, whereas the association of HP receipt and seed set was negative and not significantly different among sites. Our results demonstrate variation in the quantity and fitness effect of pollen receipt across sites, which is a precondition for evolution of local adaptation.

However, the molecular composition and the biological role of these EVs are still unclear. The present study had two main aims: (I) to clarify whether pollen germination is needed to release pollensomes, or if they can be secreted also in high humidity conditions; and (II) to investigate the molecular features of pollensomes following the most recent guidelines for EVs isolation and identification. To do so, pollensomes were isolated from hydrated and germinated kiwi (<i>Actinidia chinensis</i> Planch.) pollen, and characterized using imaging techniques, immunoblotting, and proteomics. These analyses revealed that only germinated kiwi pollen released detectable concentrations of nanoparticles compatible with small EVs for shape and protein content. Moreover, a plant homolog of ALIX, which is a well-recognized and accepted marker of small EVs and exosomes in mammals, was found in pollensomes.

In the last two decades in India, 83 pollens, 34 fungi, six dust mite and 19 insect species were reported as allergenic, often contributing to heavy allergenic exposure in indoor and outdoor environments. There are currently few practitioners who offer allergy diagnosis and treatment in India, but there is active basic and molecular research aiming to improve the health of allergic patients. This review explores the field of aero-allergy in India during the last two decades, with special emphasis on prevalence across various centres and relevant scientific advances such as genetic associations and new therapeutics. This review will be helpful for clinicians to select aero-allergens for sensitisation testing in patients suffering from symptoms in different regions of India, and to support patients undertaking prophylaxis of allergic symptoms in India according to local environmental conditions. This study also helps to define patient selection for allergy testing and the role of test results in guiding allergic disease management in the Indian context.

However, the management of Western honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i> L.) in urban areas may represent a new threat to wild bee communities. Urban beekeeping is commonly perceived as an environmentally friendly practice or a way to combat pollinator declines, when high-density beekeeping operations may actually have a negative influence on native and wild bee populations through floral resource competition and pathogen transmission. On the Island of Montr&#xe9;al, Canada there has been a particularly large increase in beekeeping across the city. Over the years following a large bee diversity survey ending in 2013, there was an influx of almost three thousand honey bee colonies to the city. In this study, we examined the wild bee communities and floral resources across a gradient of honey bee abundances in urban greenspaces in 2020, and compared the bee communities at the same sites before and after the large influx of honey bees. Overall, we found a negative relationship between urban beekeeping, pollen availability, and wild bee species richness. We also found that honey bee abundance had the strongest negative effect on small (inter-tegular span &lt;2.25 mm) wild bee species richness. Small bee species may be at higher risk in areas with abundant honey bee populations as their limited foraging range may reduce their access to floral resources in times of increased competition. Further research on the influence of urban beekeeping on native and wild pollinators, coupled with evidence-based beekeeping regulations, is essential to ensure cities contain sufficient resources to support wild bee diversity alongside managed honey bees.","02","2023","10","PeerJ","PeerJ","Beekeeping; Biodiversity; Exploitative competition; Honey bees; Native bees; Pollinators; Urban; Wild bees; Animals; Bees; Ecosystem; Flowers; Pollen; Beekeeping; Cities","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:10:48.367119-04:00","No","","NaT"

However, the mechanism of tobacco CMS formation remains unknown. Using paraffin section observation, transcriptome sequencing, and TMT proteomic analysis, this study describes the differences in expression profiles in morphology, transcription, and translation between the sua-CMS tobacco line (MSYY87) and its corresponding maintainer line (YY87). According to the microspore morphology, MSYY87 began to exhibit abnormal microspore development during the early stages of germination and differentiation (androgynous primordium differentiation stage). According to transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, 17 genes/proteins involved in lipid transport/binding and phenylpropane metabolism were significantly down-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. Through further analysis, we identified some key genes that may be involved in tobacco male sterility, including &#x3b2;-GLU related to energy metabolism, 4CL and bHLHs related to anther wall formation, nsLTPs related to pollen germination and anther cuticle, and bHLHs related to pollen tapetum degradation. We speculate that the down-regulation of these genes affects the normal physiological metabolism, making tobacco plants show male sterility. SIGNIFICANCE: Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) plays a vital role in utilizing tobacco heterosis and enhancing crop yield and quality. We observed paraffin sections and conducted transcriptome sequencing and mitochondrial proteomics to examine the tobacco CMS line Yunyan 87 (MSYY87) and its maintainer line Yunyan 87 (YY87). The down-regulation expression of &#x3b2;-GLU resulted in insufficient ATP supply, which resulted in disordered energy metabolism. The down-regulation expression of 4CL, nsLTPs and bHLHs may affect the formation of anther wall and anther cuticle, pollen germination, as well as the degradation of pollen tapetum. These various abnormal physiological processes, the male sterility of tobacco is finally caused. The findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms of tobacco CMS and serve as a model for fertility research in other flowering plants.","02","2023","15","J Proteomics","Journal of proteomics","Cytoplasmic male sterility; Nicotiana tabacum L.; Proteomics; Transcriptomics; Male; Humans; Transcriptome; Tobacco; Proteome; Plant Infertility; Proteomics; Paraffin; Gene Expression Profiling; Infertility, Male; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Flowers","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:56:44.858543-04:00","No","","NaT"

There is demand for the development of automated pollen monitoring systems. Low-cost Optical Particle Counters (OPCs) measure particulate matter and have attractive advantages of real-time high time resolution data and affordable costs. This study asks whether low-cost OPC sensors can be used for meaningful monitoring of airborne pollen. We employ a variety of methods, including supervised machine learning techniques, to construct pollen proxies from hourly-average OPC data and evaluate their performance, holding out 40 % of observations to test the proxies. The most successful methods are supervised machine learning Neural Network (NN) and Random Forest (RF) methods, trained from pollen concentrations collected from a Hirst-type sampler. These perform significantly better than using a simple particle size-filtered proxy or a Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF) source apportionment pollen proxy. Twelve NN and RF models were developed to construct a pollen proxy, each varying by model type, input features and target variable. The results show that such models can construct useful information on pollen from OPC data. The best metrics achieved (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.85, coefficient of determination = 0.67) were for the NN model constructing a Poaceae (grass) pollen proxy, based on particle size information, temperature, and relative humidity. Ability to distinguish high pollen events was evaluated using F1 Scores, a score reflecting the fraction of true positives with respect to false positives and false negatives, with promising results (F1 &#x2264; 0.83). Model-constructed proxies demonstrated the ability to follow monthly and diurnal trends in pollen. We discuss the suitability of OPCs for monitoring pollen and offer advice for future progress. We demonstrate an attractive alternative for automated pollen monitoring that could provide valuable and timely information to the benefit of pollen allergy sufferers.","03","2023","13","Sci Total Environ","The Science of the total environment","Aerobiology; Automatic monitoring; Low-cost sensors; Machine learning; Optical Particle Counter (OPC); Pollen; Random Forest; Pollen; Neural Networks, Computer; Particulate Matter; Particle Size; Poaceae; Allergens; Environmental Monitoring","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 19:05:26.917294-04:00","No","","NaT"

We show that mutant plants produce embryo sacs with an abnormal structure or with various numbers of nuclei. Although pollen grains of heterozygous mutant plants exhibit reduced viability and reduced pollen tube growth in vitro, some of the ruvbl pollen tubes are capable of targeting ovules in vivo. Similarly, some ruvbl ovules retain the ability to attract wild-type pollen tubes but fail to develop further. The activity of the RUVBL1 and RUVBL2A promoters was observed in the embryo sac, pollen grains, and tapetum cells and, for RUVBL2A, also in developing ovules.

The production of the innermost intine layer, composed of cellulose, pectin and other polymers, is particularly poorly understood. Here we demonstrate an important and specific role for the hydroxyproline O-arabinosyltransferase (HPAT) FIN4 in tomato intine development. HPATs are plant-specific enzymes which initiate glycosylation of certain cell wall structural proteins and signaling peptides. FIN4 was expressed throughout pollen development in both the developing pollen and surrounding tapetal cells. A fin4 mutant with a partial deletion of the catalytic domain displayed significantly reduced male fertility in vivo and compromised pollen hydration and germination in vitro. However, fin4 pollen that successfully germinated formed morphologically normal pollen tubes with the same growth rate as the wild-type pollen. When we examined mature fin4 pollen, we found they were cytologically normal, and formed morphologically normal exine, but produced significantly thinner intine. During intine deposition at the late stages of pollen development we found fin4 pollen had altered polymer deposition, including reduced cellulose and increased detection of pectin, specifically homogalacturonan with both low and high degrees of methylesterification. Therefore, FIN4 plays an important role in intine formation and, in turn pollen hydration and germination and the process of intine formation involves dynamic changes in the developing pollen cell wall.","02","2023","07","Plant Reprod","Plant reproduction","Cell wall; Glycosylation; Hydration; Intine; Pollen","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:15:18.014424-04:00","No","","NaT"

"428","Different effects of pesticides on transcripts of the endocrine regulation and energy metabolism in honeybee foragers from different colonies.","36737645","10.1038/s41598-023-29257-w","Honeybees are important pollinators of many crops and contribute to biological biodiversity. For years, a decline in bee populations has been observed in certain areas. This decline in honeybees is accompanied by a decrease in pollinator services. One factor contributing to the decline of bee colonies is the exposure to pesticides. Pesticide exposure of bees, among other effects, can negatively affect orientation, memory, immune system function and gene expression. Among the altered expressed genes are transcripts of endocrine regulation and oxidative phosphorylation. Endocrine regulation plays an important role in the development of nurse bees into foragers and oxidative phosphorylation is involved in energy metabolism. Most of these transcriptional changes were investigated using mixed aged honeybees derived from the same colony. Experiments using nurse bees or foragers of the same age but from different colonies are rare. In the present study, effects of the two pesticides chlorpyrifos and pyraclostrobin on the expression of transcripts linked to endocrine regulation and oxidative phosphorylation in foragers of the same age from three different colonies are investigated to fill this gap. These two pesticides were selected because negative effects at sublethal concentrations on bees are known and because they are found in pollen and nectar of crops and wild plants. For this purpose, 20-22&#xa0;days old foragers of three different colonies were exposed to different sublethal concentrations of the selected fungicides for 24&#xa0;h, followed by analysis of the expression of buffy, vitellogenin, hbg-3, ilp-1, mrjp1, 2 and 3, cox5a, cox5b and cox17. Some significant changes in gene expression of both endocrine regulation transcripts and oxidative phosphorylation were shown. Furthermore, it became clear that forager bees from different colonies react differently. This is especially important in relation to the risk analysis of pesticides. In addition, it could be shown that the expression of hbg-3 in the brain of bees is a robust marker to distinguish nurse bees from foragers at the molecular biological level. In summary, this study clearly shows that pesticides, which are often detected in pollen and nectar, display negative effects at sublethal concentrations on bees and that it is important to use bees from different colonies for risk assessment of pesticides.","02","2023","07","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","Bees; Animals; Pesticides; Plant Nectar; Fungicides, Industrial; Chlorpyrifos; Energy Metabolism","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:53:51.254786-04:00","No","","NaT"

Spectral interpretation would benefit from better identification of the fingerprint vibrational peaks of different flavonoids and how they are affected by intermolecular interactions. The Raman spectra of two flavonoids, flavone and quercetin, were investigated through comparisons between spectra recorded from pure powders and spectra calculated with time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). For both flavone and quercetin, 17 peaks were assigned to specific molecular vibrations. Both flavonoids were found to have a split peak between 1250-1350 cm<sup>-1</sup> that is not predicted by TDDFT calculations on isolated molecules. In each case, it is shown that the addition of hydrogen bonded molecules arranged based on crystal structures reproduces the split peaks. These peaks were due to a stretching vibration of the bond between benzopyrone and phenyl rings and represent a characteristic spectral feature of flavonoids. Spectra of pollen grains from <i>Quercus virginiana</i> were also recorded and exhibit several peaks that correspond to the quercetin spectrum.","02","2023","16","J Phys Chem A","The journal of physical chemistry.

Nevertheless, the known fossil record of Passiflora is small. To date, only two fossil seed species have been unequivocally assigned to the genus. In this contribution, rare sulcate seeds from Gray Fossil Site are described as a third fossil seed species of Passiflora. Three partial seeds with sulcate sculpture from Gray Fossil Site, early Pliocene, Tennessee, USA, were examined, photographed, and measured. They were compared to samples of sulcate seeds from six extant Passiflora species in supersection Decaloba. A broader survey of sulcate seeds produced by modern species in the subgenera Decaloba, Deidamioides, and Tryphostemmatoides was done using published illustrations and descriptions. The Gray Fossil Site seeds are described as Passiflora sulcatasperma, sp. nov., and assigned to subgenus Decaloba, supersection Decaloba. They are characterized by their small size, elliptical shape, ridged-and-sulcate sculpture, rugulose ridges, and thin palisade seed coat. The two largest subgenera of Passiflora can be identified from Neogene fossils. Subgenus Decaloba is represented by two fossil seed species, P. bulgarica (Miocene, Bulgaria) and P. sulcatasperma (Pliocene, USA). Subgenus Passiflora is represented by fossil pollen (Miocene, Argentina and Brazil) and P. appalachiana seeds (Pliocene, USA).

In this study, we identified 18 members of the <i>Prunus dulcis PdSkp1</i> family that were unevenly distributed across six chromosomes of the almond genome. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the <i>PdSkp1</i> members can be divided into three groups: I, II, and III. <i>PdSkp1</i> members in each subfamily have relatively conserved motif types and exon/intron numbers. There were three pairs of fragment duplication genes and one pair of tandem repeat genes, and their functions were highly evolutionarily conserved. Transcriptome data showed that <i>PdSkp1</i> is expressed in almond flower tissues, and that its expression shows significant change during cross-pollination. Fluorescence quantitative results showed that eight <i>PdSkp1</i> genes had different expression levels in five tissues of almond, i.e., branches, leaves, flower buds, flesh, and cores. In addition, we cloned a <i>PsdSSK1</i> gene based on <i>PdSkp1</i>. The cloned <i>PsdSSK1</i> showed the same protein sequence as <i>PdSkp1-12</i>.

Fifty children with SAR were enrolled in this study and were randomly assigned to either the PMBL group or the placebo group. The severity of SAR symptoms was assessed using the total nasal symptom score (TNSS) and visual analogue scale (VAS). During two visits (V1, V2), peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) was measured and peripheral blood was collected for immunological analyses. The study also included 2 telephone contacts (TC1, TC2). The severity of the nasal symptoms of SAR on the TNSS scale was revealed to have a significantly lower impact in the PMBL group vs the placebo group at measuring points TC1 and V2 (p = 0.01, p = 0.009, respectively). A statistically significantly lower mean severity of nasal symptoms of SAR on the VAS scale was recorded for children in the PMBL group compared to the placebo group at measuring points TC1, V2 and TC2 (p = 0.04, p = 0.04, p = 0.03, respectively). The compared groups do not show significant differences in terms of PNIF values at individual measuring points. There were no statistically significant changes in immune variables. For both groups, there was a statistically significant association between the level of Th1-like &#x3b3;&#x3b4;T cells and the severity of SAR symptoms expressed on the TNSS scale (p = 0.03) - the lower the level of Th1-like &#x3b3;&#x3b4;T cells, the higher the TNSS value.

Therefore, maintaining the yield quality and quantity is essential, especially for high-end value-added products. Knowledge on floral behaviour and reproductive biology is essential for breeding superior varieties and is critical for commercial cultivation efforts. However, limited literature is available on the floral biology of C. verum. Here in this study, we assessed the seasonal flowering, floral development and pollination of two cultivars of C. verum. Both macroscopic and microscopic data were collected on floral biology, pollination, and male and female floral organs before and after pollination. Cinnamomum verum is morpho-anatomically, structurally, and physiologically adapted for cross-pollination, possible between the two cultivars; type A (Sri Gemunu) and type B (Sri Wijaya) flowers; naturally evolved with Protogynous Dichogamy. However, due to changes in environmental conditions, female and male stages in the same tree overlap for about 45-60 min suggesting possible close-pollination within the same plant. During this event some of the pollens were observed hydrated even during self-pollination. In mean time, 4-8% of the flowers formed fruits after natural close and hand pollination which is between male and female phases of the same tree. Although C. verum is adapted for cross-pollination, natural close-pollination is also possible. The data suggest the complex nature of the sexual reproduction of C. verum. Well-managed breeding attempts with controlled factors like temperature and humidity will help to develop superior C. verum varieties.","02","2023","06","PLoS One","PloS one","Pollination; Cinnamomum zeylanicum; Sri Lanka; Plant Breeding; Reproduction; Flowers; Trees; Biology","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:12:07.195120-04:00","No","","NaT"

We measured reproductive success in (1) natural conditions, (2) hand-pollination experiments and (3) an experimental design, by modifying composition of inflorescences in populations of two deceptive orchids, Orchis anthropophora and O. italica, and one rewarding orchid, Anacamptis coriophora subsp. fragrans. There were no differences in natural fruit production in relation to flower position on the inflorescence (i.e. upper versus lower part), suggesting no preference of pollinators for different parts of the inflorescence. Hand-pollination experiments highlighted low pollen limitation in A. coriophora subsp. fragrans but high limitation in O. italica and O. anthropophora. Reproductive success of deceptive orchids in experimental plots decreased significantly when flowers on the upper half of the inflorescence were removed leading to reduced floral display, while reproductive success of the nectariferous species did not differ significantly. Our data highlight that in the examined orchids there is no clear relationship between fruit formation and flower position along inflorescences. Thus we can affirm that, for orchids, the entire inflorescence plays a dominant role in insect attraction but the part of the flower spike does not influence the choice of the insect. This implies that all flowers have the same possibility of receiving visits from pollinators, and therefore each flower has the same opportunity to set fruit.","03","2023","29","Plant Biol (Stuttg)","Plant biology (Stuttgart, Germany)","Flower position; Orchidaceae; inflorescence; pollinators; reproductive success; Pollination; Inflorescence; Flowers; Reproduction; Fruit; Orchidaceae","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:14:53.656892-04:00","No","","NaT"

No mutant phenotype was observed in single knockout mutants; however, genetic suppression of these LPPs affected pollen growth and ER phospholipid biosynthesis in mature siliques and seeds with compromised triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Although chloroplast-localized, LPP&#x3b5;1 was localized close to the ER and ER-localized LPP&#x3b1;2. This proximal localization is functionally relevant, because overexpression of chloroplastic LPP&#x3b5;1 enhanced ER phospholipid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis similar to the effect of LPP&#x3b1;2 overexpression in mature siliques and seeds. Thus, ER glycerolipid metabolism requires a chloroplast-localized enzyme in Arabidopsis, representing the importance of inter-organelle communication in membrane lipid homeostasis.","04","2023","24","Plant Cell","The Plant cell","Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Phosphatidate Phosphatase; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Phospholipids; Membrane Lipids; Lipid Metabolism; Triglycerides","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:42:10.745754-04:00","No","","NaT"
"444","Pollen tube invasive growth is promoted by callose.","36717422","10.1007/s00497-023-00458-7","Callose, a &#x3b2;-1,3-glucan, lines the pollen tube cell wall except for the apical growing region, and it constitutes the main polysaccharide in pollen tube plugs. These regularly deposited plugs separate the active portion of the pollen tube cytoplasm from the degenerating cell segments. They have been hypothesized to reduce the total amount of cell volume requiring turgor regulation, thus aiding the invasive growth mechanism. To test this, we characterized the growth pattern of Arabidopsis callose synthase mutants with altered callose deposition patterns. Mutant pollen tubes without callose wall lining or plugs had a wider diameter but grew slower compared to their respective wildtype. To probe the pollen tube's ability to perform durotropism in the absence of callose, we performed mechanical assays such as growth in stiffened media and assessed turgor through incipient plasmolysis. We found that mutants lacking plugs had lower invading capacity and higher turgor pressure when faced with a mechanically challenging substrate. To explain this unexpected elevation in turgor pressure in the callose synthase mutants we suspected that it is enabled by feedback-driven increased levels of de-esterified pectin and/or cellulose in the tube cell wall. Through immunolabeling we tested this hypothesis and found that the content and spatial distribution of these cell wall polysaccharides was altered in callose-deficient mutant pollen tubes. Combined, the results reveal how callose contributes to the pollen tube's invasive capacity and thus plays an important role in fertilization. In order to understand, how the pollen tube deposits callose, we examined the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in the spatial targeting of callose synthases to the cell surface. The spatial proximity of actin with locations of callose deposition and the dramatic effect of pharmacological interference with actin polymerization suggest a potential role for the cytoskeleton in the spatial control of the characteristic wall assembly process in pollen tubes.","01","2023","30","Plant Reprod","Plant reproduction","Actin; Arabidopsis thaliana; Callose; Callose synthases; Cell wall; Fertilization; Invasive growth; Pollen tube; Reproduction","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:15:25.455121-04:00","No","","NaT"
"446","The effect of global warming on the Australian endemic orchid Cryptostylis leptochila and its pollinator.","36716308","10.1371/journal.pone.0280922","Ecological stability together with the suitability of abiotic conditions are crucial for long-term survival of any organism and the maintenance of biodiversity and self-sustainable ecosystems relies on species interactions. By influencing resource availability plants affect the composition of plant communities and ultimately ecosystem functioning. Plant-animal interactions are very complex and include a variety of exploitative and mutualistic relationships. One of the most important mutualistic interactions is that between plants and their pollinators. Coevolution generates clustered links between plants and their pollen vectors, but the pollination and reproductive success of plants is reduced by increase in the specialization of plant-animal interactions. One of the most specialized types of pollination is sexual deception, which occurs almost exclusively in Orchidaceae. In this form of mimicry, male insects are attracted to orchid flowers by chemical compounds that resemble insect female sex pheromones and pollinate the flowers during attempted copulations. These interactions are often species-specific with each species of orchid attracting only males of one or very few closely related species of insects. For sexually deceptive orchids the presence of a particular pollen vector is crucial for reproductive success and any reduction in pollinator availability constitutes a threat to the orchid. Because global warming is rapidly becoming the greatest threat to all organisms by re-shaping the geographical ranges of plants, animals and fungi, this paper focuses on predicting the effect of global warming on Cryptostylis leptochila, a terrestrial endemic in eastern Australia that is pollinated exclusively via pseudo copulation with Lissopimpla excelsa. As a species with a single pollinator this orchid is a perfect model for studies on the effect of global warming on plants and their pollen vectors. According to our predictions, global warming will cause a significant loss of suitable niches for C. leptochila. The potential range of this orchid will be 36%-75% smaller than currently and as a result the Eastern Highlands will become unsuitable for C. leptochila. On the other hand, some new niches will become available for this species in Tasmania. Simultaneously, climate change will result in a substantial expansion of niches suitable for the pollinator (44-82%). Currently ca. 71% of the geographical range of the orchid is also suitable for L. excelsa, therefore, almost 30% of the areas occupied by C. leptochila already lack the pollen vector. The predicted availability of the pollen vector increased under three of the climate change scenarios analysed. The predicted habitat loss is a serious threat to this orchid even with the potential colonization of Tasmania by this plant. In the reduced range of C. leptochila the pollen vector will also be present assuring fruit set in populations of this orchid. The genetic pool of the populations in New South Wales and Queensland will probably be lost.","02","2023","01","PLoS One","PloS one","Animals; Male; Ecosystem; Global Warming; Australia; Reproduction; Pollination; Insecta; Orchidaceae; Flowers","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:49:38.426735-04:00","No","","NaT"

We investigated how distance from the previous year's OSR crop influences the infestation and parasitism rates of two of its most important pests: the pollen beetle (Brassicogethes aeneus) and the cabbage seed weevil (Ceutorhynchus obstrictus). When the distance from the previous year's OSR crop was &gt;500&#x2009;m, we recorded significantly reduced pest pressure by both B. aeneus and C. obstrictus in the study fields.

The GSE50101, GSE72541, GSE50222 and OEP002482 were mined for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or co-expressed genes and differentially methylated genes (DMGs) in AR and CSU patients.

Among these stressors are pesticides, chemicals that are originally designed to target crop-harming organisms but that also disrupt various functions in pollinators, including flight, communication, orientation and memory. Although all these functions are crucial for reproductive individuals when searching for mates or nesting places, it remains poorly understood how pesticides affect reproduction in pollinators. In this study, we investigated how a widely used fungicide, boscalid, affects reproduction in honey bees (Apis mellifera), an eusocial insect in which a single individual, the queen, fulfills the reproductive functions of the whole colony. Boscalid is a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide mainly used on rapeseed flowers to target mitochondrial respiration in fungi but it is also suspected to disrupt foraging-linked functions in bees. We found that immature queen exposure to sublethal, field relevant doses of boscalid disrupted reproduction, as indicated by a dramatic increase in queen mortality during and shortly after the nuptial flights period and a decreased number of spermatozoa stored in the spermatheca of surviving queens. However, we did not observe a decreased paternity frequency in exposed queens that successfully established a colony. Queen exposure to boscalid had detrimental consequences on the colonies they later established regarding brood production, Varroa destructor infection and pollen storage but not nectar storage and population size. These perturbations at the colony-level correspond to nutritional stress conditions, and may have resulted from queen reduced energy provisioning to the eggs. Accordingly, we found that exposed queens had decreased gene expression levels of vitellogenin, a protein involved in egg-yolk formation. Overall, our results indicate that boscalid decreases honey bee queen reproductive quality, thus supporting the need to include reproduction in the traits measured during pesticide risk assessment procedures.","03","2023","06","Environ Pollut","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","Apis mellifera; Colony health; Gene expression; Pesticides; Queen; SDHI fungicide; Male; Bees; Animals; Fungicides, Industrial; Pesticides; Biphenyl Compounds; Reproduction","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 19:07:11.523821-04:00","No","","NaT"

In Arabidopsis (A. thaliana), a rate-limiting step in ascorbate biosynthesis is a phosphorylase encoded by Vitamin C Defective 2 (VTC2). To specifically overexpress VTC2 (VTC2 OE) in pollen, the coding region was expressed using a promoter from a gene with &#x223c;150-fold higher expression in pollen, leading to pollen grains with an eight-fold increased VTC2 mRNA. VTC2 OE resulted in a near-sterile phenotype with a 50-fold decrease in pollen transmission efficiency and a five-fold reduction in the number of seeds per silique. In vitro assays revealed pollen grains were more prone to bursting (greater than two-fold) or produced shorter, morphologically abnormal pollen tubes. The inclusion of a genetically encoded Ca2+ reporter, mCherry-GCaMP6fast (CGf), revealed pollen tubes with altered tip-focused Ca2+ dynamics and increased bursting frequency during periods of oscillatory and arrested growth. Despite these phenotypes, VTC2 OE pollen failed to show expected increases in ascorbate or reductions in reactive oxygen species, as measured using a redox-sensitive dye or a roGFP2. However, mRNA expression analyses revealed greater than two-fold reductions in mRNA encoding two enzymes critical to biosynthetic pathways related to cell walls or glyco-modifications of lipids and proteins: GDP-d-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMP) and GDP-d-mannose 3',5' epimerase (GME).

To measure fungicide exposure, we sampled commercial honey bee colonies during orchard bloom at two commercial tart cherry orchards and one holding yard in northern Michigan over two seasons. Nurse bees, foragers, larvae, pollen, bee bread, and wax were screened for captan, chlorothalonil, and thiophanate-methyl. We also looked at the composition of pollens collected by foragers during spring bloom. We found differences in fungicide residue levels between nurse bees and foragers, with higher captan levels in nurse bees. We also found that residue levels of chlorothalonil in workers were significantly increased during tart cherry bloom, and that nurse bees from hives adjacent to orchards had significantly higher chlorothalonil residues than nurse bees from hives kept in a holding yard. Our results suggest that fungicide exposure of individual honey bees depends greatly on hive location in relation to mass-flowering crops, and worker role (life stage) at the time of collection. In some pollen samples, captan and chlorothalonil were detected at levels known to cause negative health effects for honey bees.

One of the reasons for changes in redox states of vertebrates leading to oxidative stress scenario is the disruption of the endocrine system. Comprehending the dynamics of hormonal status to redox state and oxidative stress in living systems is challenging. It is more difficult to come to a unifying conclusion when some hormones exhibit oxidant properties while others have antioxidant features. There is a very limited approach to correlate alteration in titers of hormones with redox status and oxidative stress with growth, development, aging, and pathophysiological stress. The situation is further complicated when considering various tissues and sexes in vertebrates. This chapter discusses the beneficial impacts of hormones with antioxidative properties, such as melatonin, glucagon, insulin, estrogens, and progesterone, which protect cells from oxidative damage and reduce pathophysiological effects. Additionally, we discuss the protective effects of antioxidants like vitamins A, E, and C, curcumin, tempol, N-acetyl cysteine, &#x3b1;-lipoic acid, date palm pollen extract, resveratrol, and flavonoids on oxidative stress triggered by hormones such as aldosterone, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, and catecholamines.

Our objective was to evaluate allergen-bearing liposomes as possible alternative for alum-adsorption in SCIT. A self-assembling, coiled-coil forming peptide pair was used to anchor the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 to the surface of cationic liposomes. The resulting nanoparticulate liposomes were characterized with respect to their physicochemical, allergenic and immunological properties. Allergenicity was studied by ImmunoCAP inhibition and rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cell assays. Immunogenicity (immunoglobulin responses) and immune skewing (cytokine responses) were evaluated upon immunization of na&#xef;ve mice, and compared to alum-adsorbed Bet v 1. Bet v 1-bearing cationic liposomes with a diameter of &#x223c;200&#x2005;nm showed a positive zeta potential. The coiled-coil conjugation of Bet v 1 to the surface of liposomes resulted in about a 15-fold lower allergenicity than soluble Bet v 1 as judged by RBL assays. Moreover, the nanoparticles induced Bet v 1-specific IgG<sub>1</sub>/IgG<sub>2a</sub> responses in mice that were several orders of magnitude higher than those induced by alum-adsorbed Bet v 1. This strong humoral response was accompanied by a relatively strong IL-10 induction upon PBMC stimulation with Bet v 1. In conclusion, their hypo-allergenic properties, combined with their capacity to induce a strong humoral immune response and a relatively strong IL-10 production, makes these allergen-covered cationic liposomes a promising alternative for aluminum salt-adsorption of allergen currently used in SCIT.","02","2023","02","Front Allergy","Frontiers in allergy","aluminum; bet v 1; hypo-allergenic; liposomes; mice","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:09:18.688622-04:00","No","","NaT"

In particular, the activation of allergen-specific helper T cells towards a type 2 (Th2) phenotype during the first encounters with the allergen, also known as the sensitization phase, is the leading cause of the subsequent development of allergic disease. Infants and children are especially prone to developing Th2 cell responses after initial contact with allergens. But in addition, the rates of allergic sensitization and the development of allergic diseases among children are increasing in the industrialized world and have been associated with living in urban settings. Particularly for respiratory allergies, greater susceptibility to developing allergic Th2 cell responses has been shown in children living in urban environments containing low levels of microbial contaminants, principally bacterial endotoxins [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], in the causative aeroallergens. This review highlights the current understanding of the factors that balance Th2 cell immunity to environmental allergens, with a particular focus on the determinants that program conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) toward or away from a Th2 stimulatory function. In this context, it discusses transcription factor-guided functional specialization of type-2 cDCs (cDC2s) and how the integration of signals derived from the environment drives this process. In addition, it analyzes observational and mechanistic studies supporting an essential role for innate sensing of microbial-derived products contained in aeroallergens in modulating allergic Th2 cell immune responses. Finally, this review examines whether hyporesponsiveness to microbial stimulation, particularly to LPS, is a risk factor for the induction of Th2 cell responses and allergic sensitization during infancy and early childhood and the potential factors that may affect early-age response to LPS and other environmental microbial components.","02","2023","02","Front Allergy","Frontiers in allergy","GM-CSF; IL-12 cytokine; IL-2 cytokine; LPS (lipopolysaccharide); T-bet; Th2 cells; dendritic cells; infants","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:48:44.559309-04:00","No","","NaT"

Recently, compounds that alter histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been reported to enhance microspore embryogenesis (ME), by altering histones acetylation or methylation. However, epigenetic mechanisms underlying ME induction efficiency are poorly understood. In this study, the epigenetic dynamics and the expression of genes associated with histone PTMs and ME induction were studied in two bread wheat cultivars with different ME response. Microspores isolated at 0, 3 and 5 days, treated with 0.7M mannitol (MAN) and 0.7M mannitol plus 0.4&#xb5;M trichostatin A (TSA), which induced ME more efficiently, were analyzed. An additional control of gametophytic development was included. Microspores epigenetic state at the onset of ME induction was distinctive between cultivars by the ratio of H3 variants and their acetylated forms, the localization and percentage of labeled microspores with H3K9ac, H4K5ac, H4K16ac, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3, and the expression of genes related to pollen development. These results indicated that microspores of the high responding cultivar could be at a less advanced stage in pollen development. MAN and TSA resulted in a hyperacetylation of H3.2, with a greater effect of TSA. Histone PTMs were differentially affected by both treatments, with acetylation being most concerned. The effect of TSA was observed in the H4K5ac localization pattern at 3dT in the mid-low responding cultivar. Three gene networks linked to ME response were identified. <i>TaHDT1, TaHAG2, TaYAO</i>, <i>TaNFD6-A</i>, <i>TabZIPF1</i> and <i>TaAGO802-B</i>, associated with pollen development, were down-regulated. <i>TaHDA15</i>, <i>TaHAG3</i>, <i>TaHAM, TaYUC11D</i>, <i>Ta-2B-LBD16 TaMS1</i> and <i>TaDRM3</i> constituted a network implicated in morphological changes by auxin signaling and cell wall modification up-regulated at 3dT.

The results indicated that TSA mainly modified the regulation of genes related to pollen and auxin signaling.

Although honey bees can provide compensatory pollination services, their service to buzz-pollinated crops, compared to specialized pollinators, is not clear.

We first compared the relative frequency and abundance of both bee types on flowers of both crops. Secondly, we controlled access to flowers to compare the number and weight of fruit and number of seed produced after single visits of AHB and native bees. For a better assessment of pollination services, we evaluated the productivity of individual flowers multiply visited by AHB. The results were compared against treatments using pollinator-excluded flowers and flowers that were supplied with additional pollen, which allowed an overall measure of pollination service provision (PSP). Our results showed that AHB were the predominant flower visitors in both crops and that were poorly efficient on individual visits. Notably, fruit quantity and seed number increased concomitantly with the number of AHB visits per flower on eggplant, but not on annatto. Estimation of PSP revealed no pollination deficit on eggplant but that a deficit existed on the pollination services to annatto. We found that AHB numerical predominance compensates their poor individual performance and can complement the services of native bees on eggplant, but not on annatto.

The efficacy of wearable smart watches in improving medication adherence is currently unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel smart watch in improving medication adherence and symptom control in patients with AR. The reliability of self-reported medication use was also investigated. This randomized, open-label, parallel controlled, pilot study enrolled adult patients with AR caused by cypress pollen. Patients were randomized in a 1:2 ratio to an intervention group and control group. Smart watches were only distributed to patients in the intervention group. During the cypress pollen season, all patients were required to take oral antihistamines daily and use nasal corticosteroids and antihistamine eye drops as needed. Daily AR symptom scores and medication usage were recorded in both groups. The smart watch was able to identify medication-taking behaviors of patients via artificial intelligence (AI) and relay this information to physicians, who sent short message service reminders to patients who forgot to take oral antihistamines for more than 2 days. During the pollen season, the adherence rate to oral antihistamines in the intervention group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;17) was significantly higher than that in the control group (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;38) (63.3%&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;28.5% versus 43.2%&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;30.2%, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.02).

The Korean Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology revised clinical guidelines of AR to address key clinical questions of the management of AR. Part 1 of the revised guideline covers the pharmacological management of patients with AR in Korea. Through a meta-analysis and systematic review, we made 4 recommendations for AR pharmacotherapy, including intranasal corticosteroid (INCS)/intranasal antihistamine (INAH) combination therapy, oral antihistamine/INCS combination therapy, leukotriene receptor antagonist treatment in AR patients with asthma, and prophylactic treatment for patients with pollen-induced AR. However, all recommendations are conditional because of the low or very low evidence of certainty.

Micronuclei formation, a proxy for genome elimination, was similar in control and heat-treated flowers, indicating that heat-induced seed abortion occurred at a late stage during the development of the seed. In the seeds derived from heat-treated crosses, the endosperm did not cellularize and many seeds aborted. Haploid seeds were formed, however, resulting in increased frequencies of haploids in CENH3-mediated genome elimination crosses performed under heat stress. Therefore, heat stress application is a selective force during genome elimination that promotes haploid formation and may be used to improve the development and efficacy of in vivo haploid induction systems.","01","2023","24","Plant Reprod","Plant reproduction","CENH3; Genome elimination; Haploid induction; Haploid induction ratio (HIR); Heat stress","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:09:31.626281-04:00","No","","NaT"

Here, we determined the spatiotemporal changes in ABA and ROS levels, and their relationships with tapetal PCD under HT exposure. Mutants lacking ABA-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2) functions and exogenous ABA treatments were used to explore the effects of ABA signalling on the induction of PCD and ROS accumulation during pollen development. HT-induced pollen abortion was tightly associated with ABA accumulation and oxidative stress. The higher ABA level in HT-stressed anthers resulted in the earlier initiation of PCD induction and subsequently abnormal tapetum degeneration by activating ROS accumulation in developing anthers. Interactions between SAPK2 and DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase elF4A-1 (RH4) were required for ABA-induced ROS generation in developing anthers.

In this study, ten cultivars were characterized for 20 traits to identify reproductive stage (R1-R6) drought-tolerant soybean. Drought stress resulted in a marked reduction (17%) in pollen germination. The reduced stomatal conductance coupled with high canopy temperature resulted in reduced seed number (45%) and seed weight (35%). Drought stress followed by rehydration increased the hundred seed weight at the compensation of seed number. Further, soybean oil decreased, protein increased, and cultivars responded differently under drought compared to control. In general, cultivars with high tolerance scores for yield displayed lower tolerance scores for quality content and vice versa. Among ten cultivars, LS5009XS and G4620RX showed maximum stress tolerance scores for seed number and seed weight. The observed variability in leaf reflectance properties and their relationship with physiological or yield components suggested that leaf-level sensing information can be used for differentiating drought-sensitive soybean cultivars from tolerant ones.

The patients were evaluated before AIT during the pollen season and in the next pollen season after introduction of subcutaneous immunotherapy. On both occasions, determination of total nasal symptom score (TNSS), rhinomanometry and nasal cytology were performed. All examined parameters significantly improved after one course of allergen immunotherapy: the percentage of eosinophils in nasal mucosa, TNSS and nasal resistance decreased, whereas the nasal flow rate increased.

From the perspective of indoor air quality, while there are numerous studies on outdoor bioaerosol exposure, there are still uncertainties regarding the diversity and deposition of airborne pollen and fungi indoors. When it comes to schools, there is limited research as to the potential bioaerosol exposure. Here we studied the indoor environment of public schools aiming to reveal whether primary schools of different sizes and at localities of different levels of urbanization may exhibit a variability in the biodiversity and abundance of particles of biological origin, which could pose a risk to child health. To achieve this, 11 schools were selected, located in a variety of environments, from downtown, to city centre-periphery, and to the suburbs. Fungal and pollen samples were collected from various surfaces in school classrooms and corridors, using passive air sampling and swab sampling. We demonstrated that fungi and pollen are detected in school premises during and after the vegetation season. The highest diversity of bioaerosols was found on the top of cabinets and windowsills, with <i>Penicillium</i>, <i>Cladosporium</i> and <i>Acremonium</i> being the most abundant indoors. The levels of fungi were higher in schools with more students. The diversity and amount of pollen in the spring were significantly higher than in samples collected in autumn. Our findings complemented existing evidence that bioaerosol measurements in schools (including kindergartens or informal education facilities) are vital. Hence, we here suggest that, in addition to monitoring air quality and bacterial levels indoors, fungi and pollen measurements have to be integrated in the existing regular biomonitoring campaigns so as to prevent exposure, increase awareness and manage efficiently allergic symptomatology.","02","2023","01","Heliyon","Heliyon","Aerobiology; Allergy; Bioaerosol monitoring; Environmental health; Fungal spores; Indoor air quality; Pollen concentration","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:43:34.733463-04:00","No","","NaT"

Although SWEET genes have been characterized and identified in model plants, such as <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice, little is known about them in jujube. In this study, the molecular characteristics of the SWEET gene family in the Chinese jujube (<i>Ziziphus jujuba</i> Mill.) and their expression patterns in different organs, at different fruit developmental stages, and under abiotic stress were analyzed. A total of 19 ZjSWEET genes were identified in jujube through a genome-wide study; these were classified into four sub-groups based on their phylogenic relationships. The gene structure analysis of ZjSWEET genes showed that all the members had introns. The expression patterns of different ZjSWEET genes varied significantly in different organs (root, shoot, leave, flower, fruit), which indicated that ZjSWEETs play different roles in multiple organs. According to the expression profiles by quantitative real-time PCR analysis during fruit development, the expression levels of the two genes (<i>ZjSWEET11</i>, <i>ZjSWEET18</i>) gradually increased with the development of the fruit and reached a high level at the full-red fruit stage. A prediction of the <i>cis</i>-acting regulatory elements indicated that the promoter sequences of ZjSWEETs contained nine types of phytohormone-responsive <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements and six environmental factors. In addition, the expression profiles by quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that some of the ZjSWEETs responded to environmental changes; <i>ZjSWEET2</i> was highly induced in response to cold stress, and <i>ZjSWEET8</i> was significantly up-regulated in response to alkali and salt stresses.

It takes two different double lotus breeds into consideration, namely 'Sijingganshan' with a low self-crossing rate and 'Jinfurong' with a high self-crossing rate. Cytological analysis results showed that the pollen abortion caused by excessive degradation of tapetum during the single phase was the root cause for the low self-mating rate of double lotus. Subsequent transcriptome analysis revealed that the gene <i>NnPTC1</i> related to programmed tapetum cell death was significantly differentially expressed during the critical period of abortion, which further verified the specific expression of <i>NnPTC1</i> in anthers. It was found that the expression level of <i>NnPTC1</i> in 'Sijingganshan' at the mononuclear stage of its microspore development was significantly higher than that of 'Jinfurong' at the same stage. The overexpression of <i>NnPTC1</i> resulted in the premature degradation of the tapetum and significantly decreased seed setting rate. These results indicated that the <i>NnPTC1</i> gene regulated the pollen abortion of double lotus.

Gametophytic apomixis, which is common among polyploid <i>Sorbus</i> taxa, indicates the role of clonal reproduction in the evolutionary stabilization of hybridogeneous genotypes. The precise determination of the origin of seeds and their quantitative evaluation may elucidate inter-cytotype interactions, the potential role of mixed-cytotype populations in evolutionary success, and the long-term survival of some hybrid species. We investigated the reproduction modes of selected species of <i>Sorbus</i> in mixed-cytotype populations in eastern Slovakia, Central Europe. We determined the pollen quality, seed production rate, and the ploidy level of mature trees, as well as the origin of the embryo and endosperm in seeds of the stenoendemics <i>S. amici-petri</i>, <i>S. dolomiticola</i>, and <i>S. hornadensis</i>. The tetraploids <i>S. amici-petri</i> and <i>S. hornadensis</i> are characterized by regular and highly stainable pollen grains and reproduce predominantly via pseudogamous apomixis. In contrast, triploid <i>S. dolomiticola</i> usually has oval, heterogenous, and weakly stainable pollen grains, suggesting male meiotic irregularities. Although seeds originate via pseudogamous apomixis in <i>S. dolomiticola</i> as well, the ploidy level of sperm cells participating in the fertilization of central cells is usually determined by co-occurring species of different cytotypes. This suggests that maintaining mating partners is necessary for the long-term survival of a triploid species. We documented rare B<sub>III</sub> hybrids and the residual sexuality in tetraploids. The distribution of seeds of meiotic and apomeiotic origins in <i>S. amici-petri</i> shows bimodal characteristics; however, genotypes with predominantly sexual seed types are rare. Reproduction modes documented in polyploid stenoendemics of <i>Sorbus</i> and inferred microevolutionary intercytotype relationships highlight the mixed-cytotype populations as the source of biodiversity in apomictic plant complexes.

These intercellular spaces are supposed to be formed by the modulation of cell wall pectin esterification. Previously we have identified a gene preferentially expressed in pistils encoding a putative pectin acetylesterase (PAE), named <i>NtPAE1</i>. Here, we characterized the <i>NtPAE1</i> gene and performed genome-wide and phylogenetic analyses of PAEs. We identified 30 PAE sequences in the <i>N. tabacum</i> genome, distributed in four clades. The expression of <i>NtPAE1</i> was assessed by RT-qPCR and <i>in situ</i> hybridization. We confirmed <i>NtPAE1</i> preferential expression in stigmas/styles and ovaries and demonstrated its high expression in the STT. Structural predictions and comparisons between NtPAE1 and functional enzymes validated its identity as a PAE. Transgenic plants were produced, overexpressing and silencing the <i>NtPAE1</i> gene. Overexpressed plants displayed smaller flowers while silencing plants exhibited collapsed pollen grains, which hardly germinate. <i>NtPAE1</i> silencing plants do not produce fruits, due to impaired pollen tube growth in their STTs. Thus, NtPAE1 is an essential enzyme regulating pectin modifications in flowers and, ultimately, in plant reproduction.","02","2023","02","Plants (Basel)","Plants (Basel, Switzerland)","Nicotiana tabacum; fruit formation; pectin modification; pistil development; plant fertility; plant reproduction; pollen&#x2013;pistil interaction","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:56:32.326579-04:00","No","","NaT"
"493","Assessment of Morphological, Anatomical and Palynological Variation in the Medicinal Plant <i>Disporopsis longifolia</i> Craib (Asparagaceae) for Botanical Quality Control.","36678972","10.3390/plants12020259","<i>Disporopsis longifolia</i> Craib is an Asian medicinal plant belonging to the Asparagaceae family. The plants are well known for their steroidal saponins and phenolic compounds and are traditionally used as tonics for back pain, bellyache, cough, diabetes, asthma, pneumonia and rheumatism. However, they are challenging to identify to species level using morphology. This raises a serious concern for their medicinal applications where botanical quality control is essential. The most appropriate morphological, anatomical and pollen characters for species diagnosis were therefore determined. Synonyms were identified and lectotypification provided. The morphological characters were described from 76 fresh and dried specimens to include a broad range of materials from differing habitats and locations. Paraffin and peeling methods were applied for anatomical studies of leaves and stems and a modified acetolysis method was undertaken for pollen morphology. This paper compares the new character data to published data from other species in the genus, namely <i>D. aspersa</i>, <i>D. fuscopicta</i>, <i>D. jinfushanensis</i>, <i>D. pernyi</i> and <i>D. undulata.</i> This is the first report of such anatomical and pollen morphology characters for <i>D. longifolia</i>. The results provide accurate morphological, anatomical and palynological characters for quality control and are best applied in combination with each other.","02","2023","02","Plants (Basel)","Plants (Basel, Switzerland)","Asia; anatomical characters; lectotypification; medicinal plants; pollen morphology; quality control; species diagnosis; tropical plants","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:15:45.280366-04:00","No","","NaT"
"494","Taxon Cycles in Neotropical Mangroves.","36678956","10.3390/plants12020244","The concept of the taxon cycle involves successive range expansions and contractions over time, through which a species can indefinitely maintain its core distribution. Otherwise, it becomes extinct. Taxon cycles have been defined mostly for tropical island faunas; examples from continental areas are scarce, and similar case studies for plants remain unknown. Most taxon cycles have been identified on the basis of phylogeographic studies, and straightforward empirical evidence from fossils is lacking. Here, empirical fossil evidence is provided for the recurrent Eocene to the present expansion/contraction cycles in a mangrove taxon (<i>Pelliciera</i>) after a Neotropical-wide study of the available pollen records. This recurrent behavior is compatible with the concept of the taxon cycle from biogeographical, chronological and ecological perspectives. The biotic and abiotic drivers potentially involved in the initiation and maintenance of the <i>Pelliciera</i> expansion/contraction cycles are analyzed, and the ecological and evolutionary implications are discussed. Whether this could be a trend toward extinction is considered under the predictions of the taxon cycle theory. The recurrent expansion and contraction cycles identified for <i>Pelliciera</i> have strong potential for being the first empirically and unequivocally documented taxon cycles and likely the only taxon cycles documented to date for plants.","02","2023","02","Plants (Basel)","Plants (Basel, Switzerland)","Neotropical mangroves; Pelliciera; Rhizophora; expansion/contraction cycles; fossil pollen; range shifts; relict distribution; taxon cycles","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:55:15.139391-04:00","No","","NaT"
"495","Evaluation of Antioxidant and Anticancer Activity of Mono- and Polyfloral Moroccan Bee Pollen by Characterizing Phenolic and Volatile Compounds.","36677892","10.3390/molecules28020835","Bee pollen is frequently characterized as a natural source of bioactive components, such as phenolic compounds, which are responsible for its pharmaceutical potential and nutritional properties. In this study, we evaluated the bioactive compound contents of mono- and polyfloral bee pollen samples using spectroscopic and chromatographic methods and established links with their antioxidant and antitumor activity. The findings demonstrated that the botanical origin of bee pollen has a remarkable impact on its phenolic (3-17 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid (0.5-3.2 mg QE/g) contents. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of 35 phenolic and 13 phenylamide compounds in bee pollen, while gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed its richness in volatiles, such as hydrocarbons, fatty acids, alcohols, ketones, etc. The concentration of bioactive compounds in each sample resulted in a substantial distinction in their antioxidant activity, DPPH (EC<sub>50</sub>: 0.3-0.7 mg/mL), ABTS (0.8-1.3 mM Trolox/mg), and reducing power (0.03-0.05 mg GAE/g), with the most bioactive pollens being the monofloral samples from <i>Olea europaea</i> and <i>Ononis spinosa</i>. Complementarily, some samples revealed a moderate effect on cervical carcinoma (GI<sub>50</sub>: 495 &#x3bc;g/mL) and breast adenocarcinoma (GI<sub>50</sub>: 734 &#x3bc;g/mL) cell lines. This may be associated with compounds such as quercetin-<i>O</i>-diglucoside and kaempferol-3-<i>O</i>-rhamnoside, which are present in pollens from <i>Olea europaea</i> and <i>Coriandrum</i>, respectively. Overall, the results highlighted the potentiality of bee pollen to serve health-promoting formulations in the future.","01","2023","24","Molecules","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","antiradical capacity; antitumor activity; bee products; bioactive compounds; phenolic compounds; phenylamides; Animals; Bees; Antioxidants; Flavonoids; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Mass Spectrometry; Phenols; Pollen","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:55:30.155380-04:00","No","","NaT"
"496","Bee Pollen and Bread as a Super-Food: A Comparative Review of Their Metabolome Composition and Quality Assessment in the Context of Best Recovery Conditions.","36677772","10.3390/molecules28020715","Recently, functional foods have been a subject of great interest in dietetics owing not only to their nutritional value but rather their myriad of health benefits. Moreover, an increase in consumers' demands for such valuable foods warrants the development in not only production but rather tools of quality and nutrient assessment. Bee products, viz., pollen (BP) and bread, are normally harvested from the flowering plants with the aid of bees. BP is further subjected to a fermentation process in bee hives to produce the more valuable and bioavailable BB. Owing to their nutritional and medicinal properties, bee products are considered as an important food supplements rich in macro-, micro-, and phytonutrients. Bee products are rich in carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins, fatty acids, and minerals in addition to a myriad of phytonutrients such as phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, volatiles, and carotenoids. Moreover, unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs) of improved lipid profile such as linoleic, linolenic, and oleic were identified in BP and BB. This work aims to present a holistic overview of BP and BB in the context of their composition and analysis, and to highlight optimized extraction techniques to maximize their value and future applications in nutraceuticals.","01","2023","24","Molecules","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","analysis; bee bread; bee pollen; nutraceuticals; optimized extraction; phytonutrients; Bees; Animals; Bread; Anthocyanins; Pollen; Vitamins; Phytochemicals","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:50:15.453884-04:00","No","","NaT"
"497","Weakly Supervised Collaborative Learning for Airborne Pollen Segmentation and Classification from SEM Images.","36676197","10.3390/life13010247","Existing pollen identification methods heavily rely on the scale and quality of pollen images. However, there are many impurities in real-world SEM images that should be considered. This paper proposes a collaborative learning method to jointly improve the performance of pollen segmentation and classification in a weakly supervised manner. It first locates pollen regions from the raw images based on the detection model. To improve the classification performance, we segmented the pollen grains through a pre-trained U-Net using unsupervised pollen contour features. The segmented pollen regions were fed into a deep convolutional neural network to obtain the activation maps, which were used to further refine the segmentation masks. In this way, both segmentation and classification models can be collaboratively trained, supervised by just pollen contour features and class-specific information. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets were conducted, and the results prove that our method effectively avoids impurity interference and improves pollen identification accuracy (86.6%) under the limited supervision (around 1000 images with image-level labels).","02","2023","02","Life (Basel)","Life (Basel, Switzerland)","SEM; airborne allergic pollen; deep learning; pollen identification","","","","","Not Neotoma","No","This article is not of relevance for Neotoma","SimonGoring","2023-05-11 18:19:40.938544-04:00","No","","NaT"
